			<mods:abstract>ABSTRACT
Contains taxonomic revisions of four families for Malesia (i.e. the area covering the countries Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea).
Index to scientific plant names in all four families on pp. 775-784.
Ding Hou, K. Larsen &amp; S.S. Larsen, Caesalpiniaceae (Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae), pp. 409-730.
In Malesia the family contains 25 indigenous genera and 8 genera with only introduced species, as follows (in brackets the number of native and/or introduced species in Malesia): Acrocarpus (1), Afzelia (2), Amherstia (1), Bauhinia (69), Brownea (4), Caesalpinia (22), Cassia (4), Chamaecrista (5), Copaifera (1), Crudia (28), Cynometra (14), Delonix (1), Dialium (5), Endertia (1), Gleditsia (1), Haematoxylum (1), Hymenaea (2), Intsia (2), Kalappia (1), Kingiodendron (3), Koompassia (3), Leucostegane (2), Maniltoa (13), Parkinsonia (1), Peltophorum (3), Pterolobium (5), Saraca (8), Schizolobium (1), Senna (17), Sindora (15), Sympetalandra (5), Tamarindus (1), Uittienia (1). Altogether there are 200 indigenous species in the area, and 42 introduced species are also fully treated.
The general family part is by the three authors, except a chapter on palynology (R.W. J. M. van der Ham) and a chapter on phytochemistry and chemotaxonomy (R. Hegnauer). K. &amp; S.S. Larsen contributed Bauhinia. The genera Cassia, Chamaecrista, and Senna are authored by K. Larsen &amp; Ding Hou, Dialium by J. P. Rojo. Ding Hou contributed the remainder of the genera.
The family introduction covers 21 pages, not including the keys. There are two keys to the genera and one to the 'exotic' genera which are in Malesia only represented by cultivated species. For each accepted taxon, from genus to variety, there is a morphological description/diagnosis, synonymy and references, and paragraphs on habitat/ecology, distribution, uses, etc. Genera with more than one species (in the area) have a key to the species, sometimes two, and also the infraspecific taxa are keyed out.
Genera are arranged alphabetically, as are the species under each genus, only in Bauhinia the species are alphabetical under the pertinent subgenus/section.
Illustration is by 47 drawings, most of them full-page, and by five black-and- white photographs.
J.E. Laferriere, Geitonoplesiaceae, pp. 731-736.
One of the small liliaceous families, recently described as separate, formerly included in Luzuriagaceae, Philesiaceae, Smilacaceae, or earlier in Liliaceae. The family has only two monotypic genera, Eustrephus and Geitonoplesium, both occurring also in Malesia.
The family and species are described and annotated; there is a key to the genera. A paragraph on palynology is contributed by R.W. J.M. van der Ham.
Illustration is by two full-page line drawings.
B.E.E. Duyfjes, Hernandiaceae, pp. 737-761.
In the circumscription as accepted here, the family consists of four genera of which three occur in Malesia: Gyrocarpus has 1 Malesian species, Hernandia 3, Illigera 9. The general family part of 5 pages includes a paragraph on vegetative anatomy by P. Baas, a paragraph on palynology by R.W. J.M. van der Ham, and a paragraph on phytochemistry by R. Hegnauer.
The family, genera, and species are described and annotated; there are keys to the genera and species.
Illustration is by three full-page line drawings and two photographs.
K. Larsen, Lowiaceae, pp. 763-774.
A small family, only containing Orchidantha with about 10 species, 6 of which occur in Malesia. The general family part of 5 pages includes a paragraph on phytochemistry of Musaceae sensu lato by R. Hegnauer, and a paragraph on palynology of Lowiaceae by R.W. J.M. van der Ham.
The family and species are described and annotated; there is a key to the Malesian species.
Illustration is by one photograph and two line drawings.

			<feature class="distribution">
				<heading>DISTRIBUTION</heading>
				<string>The Caesalpiniaceae are a predominantly tropical group of c. 160 genera with c. 2000 species. The greatest number of genera is found in <distributionLocality class="continent">tropical Africa</distributionLocality> and <distributionLocality class="continent">tropical America</distributionLocality>. In  <distributionLocality class="region">Malesia</distributionLocality> there are 25 indigenous genera, containing 200 native species and more than 30 cultivated, introduced, or naturalized ones. In addition there are also at least eight commonly introduced or widely cultivated genera with twelve species.<br/>
Very few genera occur in the subtropical zones and only three reach the temperate regions, i.e. Cercis, Ceratonia and Gleditsia; the last one is also represented in Malesia.<br/>
The largest genus is Bauhirtia with more than 300 species throughout the tropics; it has c. 70 species in Malesia, c. 60 in Indochina and c. 40 in S China. Several species are endemics of very restricted distribution. Cassia is mainly neotropic and so are the segregate genera Senna and Chamaecrista. Caesalpinia is pantropic with 19 indigenous species in Malesia. Most other genera are relatively small and several restricted to tropical Asia. Few genera have a disjunct distribution as e.g. Copaifera occurring in tropical America, tropical Africa, and Borneo, and Gymnocladus in eastern N America and eastern Asia.</string>

			<feature class="fossils">
				<heading>FOSSILS</heading>
				<string>Fossil records of the Caesalpiniaceae, which have been attributed back to the Upper Cretaceous, are scarce but from several sites on the Northern Hemisphere. The first caesalpinioid fossils are best referred to the genera Gleditsia and Gymnocladus, genera which also in floral morphology are among the most primitive taxa in the family. From Middle Miocene in Europe a wide diversity of caesalpinioid fossils are found. For fossil pollen, see the paragraph on Palynology (p. 416).

				<heading>HABITAT AND ECOLOGY</heading>
				<string>The Caesalpiniaceae occupy a <habitat>wide range of biotopes</habitat>. Some species are restricted to the <habitat>evergreen rain forest</habitat> as, e.g., Koompassia with 2 species of very large evergreen forest trees; among the components of the evergreen forests could also be mentioned species of Sindora, Intsia and Saraca. Bauhinia consists of a large number of woody lianas, some of which are also typical rain forest species, others mainly belong to the vegetation <habitat>along forest margins</habitat> and to <habitat>open, deciduous forests</habitat>, and others again are species characteristic of the <habitat>drier savanna forests</habitat>. Some species of Caesalpinia belong to the communities of the drier parts of Malesia and some are also found in the <habitat>inner mangrove vegetation</habitat>. Pioneer species <habitat>on cleared land</habitat> are found among the species of Cassia and Senna; and some Senna and Chamaecrista are predominantly weedy.
				</string>
			</feature>
			<feature class="pollination">
				<heading>POLLINATION</heading>
				<string>Most species have maintained self-incompatibility but observations are scarce. Primitive Caesalpiniaceae appear to rely on colour contrast between anthers and petals; in advanced genera as, e.g., Parkinsonian Caesalpinia and some Bauhinia species nectar guides are evident. In Caesalpinia the upper petal and anthers are UV-absorbant. Xylo- copa bees have been recorded as visitors in, e.g., Cassia, Bauhinia and Caesalpinia. Butterfly pollination is known from Africa and the Americas; K. &amp; S.S. Larsen have observed butterfly pollination of Bauhinia nervosa and B. glauca in N Thailand (unpublished). Bird pollination is of some importance in South America and bat pollination has been observed in Bauhinia and Caesalpinia in Costa Rica and Mexico.<br/>
A number of characters important for the pollination system of Bauhinia has not yet been studied; e.g. the nectariferous disc present in several species of the Lasiobema group and the peculiar red outgrowth on the mouth of the hypanthium in B. bracteata. The opening of the anthers by pores, usually indicating buzz pollination, is found in Senna, Chamaecrista and the Palmatifolia group of Bauhinia, common all over Malesia, but it has yet to be studied in nature. Within the same group the nectar-like fluid produced by the pollensacs and excreted through the pores with the pollen may also be of importance to pollinators. Many Caesalpiniaceae are also showing a colour change from the young to the mature flower; in several Bauhinia species the colour changes from yellow or orange to red. Extrafloral nectaries are present in species of Amherstia, Caesalpinia, Chamaecrista, Delonix, Intsia, Kingiodendron, Maniltoa, and Senna.

				<heading>DISPERSAL</heading>
				<string>The fruits and seeds vary considerably, suggesting a variety of dispersal methods. Here as with the pollination biology, observations in nature are scarce. The samaras of Ptero- lobium clearly have wind dispersal; the heavy fruits, however, do not fly over long distances. In Koompassia dispersal by wind has been observed by Ridley (1930). The trees reach a height of over 50 m, overtopping the highest jungles, and the trees are often left untouched in clearings because of the very hard wood. The samaras have a slow flight, lying horizontally in the air and rapidly rotating; they have been observed to land c. 20 m from the mother tree, but most certainly they are able to fly over much longer distances.<br/>
 The arillate seeds of genera as, e.g., Afzelia and Sindora are, after they have reached the ground, attacked by rats and other rodents; it is also suggested by Ridley that the spiny pods of some Sindora species are spread epizoic. Dialium pods are dispersed by monkeys and birds. The peculiar indehiscent pods of Cassia fistula will also attract animals. Dispersal by water currents is, however, also demonstrated for this species and for, e.g., Senna siamea on the Malay Peninsula. Senna alata with winged pods could be spread by'water over shorter distances; it is in any case often found along water courses. Dispersal by water currents was observed for several species of Caesalpinia in the Malesian area. Afzelia bijuga, which is a common trees in the tidal zone, is also spread by sea currents. There are reports of monkeys feeding on several species of Senna. Bird dispersal is shown for other Senna species. In several Bauhinia species the pods open explosively spreading the seeds up to 12m according to Kerner cited in Ridley (1930).

				<heading>MORPHOLOGY</heading>
				<string>
					<subHeading>Growth habit</subHeading>Besides trees and shrubs, which are the most common life-forms, few are herbs or woody scramblers often with nodal spines, others are lianas with complex wood structures. Among the lianas there is also a great diversity from thin vines as Bauhinia curtisii to strong woody lianas as B. scandens with flattened stems or B. aureifolia in Peninsular Thailand with a basal diameter of 1 m. The lianas in the genus Bauhinia are all tendrilled; the tendrils appear at least in some cases to be modified leaves, they are often paired and arise one each from two nodes becoming adjacent as result of suppression of an internode.<br/>
					<subHeading>Leaves</subHeading>The leaves are usually spirally arranged, but in the relict genus Ceratonia opposite or subopposite. They are bipinnate in Caesalpinia and some other genera, but most groups have pinnately compound leaves, often showing within the genus a gradual reduction in number of leaf-pairs, from species with numerous pairs to a single pair or a single leaflet. The petiolules are usually unspecialized but in Afzelia and Crudia they are twisted. Stipules are nearly always present, often interpetiolar. Intrastipular spines and trichomes are present in some groups of Bauhinia, particularly in America, but in Malesia found in, e.g., B. viridescens. Extrafloral nectaries (glands) among the leaflets or on the petiole are found in Senna and Chamaecrista where they offer excellent taxo- nomic characters. Swollen and myrmecophilous petioles are found in extra-Malesian groups. Ant domatia have been described in two S American and six African genera; in Asia only in the Indian genus Humboldtia. Glandular dots caused by translucent resin ducts are found in the tribe Detarieae.<br/>
					<subHeading>Inflorescences</subHeading>Inflorescence types are various: most commonly paniculate, in other cases reduced to racemose, spicate, or even 1-flowered inflorescences. Usually they are terminal or axillary on the young branches, but cauliflory does occur in few genera. Bracts and bracteoles are variously developed; in the tribes Detarieae and Amherstieae the bracteoles are enlarged and often enclosing the flowers before anthesis; they are in these groups often persistent while in other tribes they are most often caducous. When the bracteoles are strongly developed a reduction of the calyx is often observed.<br/>
					<subHeading>Flowers</subHeading>The hypanthium is a characteristic feature. It is developed in various ways, from almost absent in very few genera to a low, cup-shaped, sometimes zygomorphic structure, to long and tubular as in some Bauhinia species. The hypanthium probably is of a complex nature, consisting of fused torus and perianth bases. Often, but not always, it is nectariferous. As the stipitate ovary is often inserted on the side or at the mouth of the hypanthium there is a close resemblance between the structure of the Bauhinia flower and the flowers of the Chrysobalanaceae, a family in which the style, however, is gynobasic, as is never the case in the Caesalpiniaceae.<br/>
Floral morphology shows a great deal of variation from small, almost regular flowers, similar to the mimosoid flowers, to large zygomorphic ones with a papilionoid similarity. The simplest floral structures with regular pentamerous flowers and often with 10 stamens are found in the tribe Caesalpinieae. In Gymnocladus and Gleditsia the flowers are effectively unisexual or polygamous, collected in racemes or small panicles. The sepals are not covering the petals in bud. Acrocarpus has more robust flowers with sepals almost covering the small, greenish petals spreading during anthesis and exposing a red cupular hypanthium. Similar primitive structures are found in Erythro- phloeum and here the presence of root nodules also suggests a close link to the Mimosa- ceae. In the Peltophorum group, mainly found in the Neotropics, the flowers develop from rather small, simple types over larger ones as in Peltophorum to very large, showy flowers in Delonix. In Caesalpinia and related genera as Pterolobium large zygomorphic flowers occur with winged dehiscent or indehiscent fruits often with a reduced number of ovules and seeds; further a variety of defence systems in the vegetative parts and fruits in the form of thorns and bristles are found.<br/>
In the tribe Cassieae there is a rich variety of floral structures from the small, regular, apetalous, polygamo-dioecious flowers of the relict genus Ceratonia over other small- flowered genera as Dialium with cymose, paniculate inflorescences to the often large, complexly structured flowers of Cassia, Senna and Chamaecrista. Particularly the development of the androecium in these last three closely related genera shows a unique diversity; basically they are 10-merous, often strongly accrescent towards the abaxial side except in Chamaecrista.<br/>
In the small tribe Cercideae the hypanthium is usually well developed and the flowers vary from small, almost regular pentamerous to large and irregular, with reduction mainly in the androecium (see further under the genus Bauhinia).<br/>
The floral morphology in the tribe Detarieae is the most diverse in the whole of the Caesalpiniaceae, as Cowan &amp; Polhill (1981) express it: "in no other part of the family has one basic type of flower been modified repeatedly in so many different ways." As a basic floral type the genus Cynometra has small, regular, pentamerous flowers with a cupular hypanthium; from this, zygomorphic flowers develop and reductions as well as multiplications in the androecium occur. There is also a great variation in the nectarial structures.<br/>
The small tribe Amherstieae is in its floral structures closely related to the Detarieae and particularly to the Cynometra type.<br/>
The caesalpinioid pistil comprises a single unilocular ovary. In an old specimen of Bauhinia aurea from China flowers with several carpels per flower have been observed (unpubl.) in the Jardin Botanique at Paris. In a collection of B. variegata from Myanmar (Sittang C137613, CAL) two free carpels of normal size were observed in one flower, in two flowers one normal and one abortive carpel were found. However, it seems that only one carpel develops into a mature pod (personal comm. by S. Bandyopadhyay, Calcutta).<br/>
					<subHeading>Fruits and seeds</subHeading>Fruits also vary considerably from the up to 80 cm long, indehis- cent, terete pods of Cassia, in which the cavity is divided by transverse septa, to the smaller, flattened, elastically dehiscent pods of Chamaecrista and the variability of pod shape and size in Senna. In other genera the fruits are cordate, falcate, linear, ovoid, strap-shaped, reniform, samaroid, etc. The base may be truncate, rounded, or tapering; apically the same forms are found, and often the style becomes lignified and persistent. The stipe or gynophore also becomes lignified and often lengthens during maturity, up to 14 cm, usually much shorter, however.<br/>
The fruit surface is glabrous and shining or covered with an indumentum, or in species of Sindora and Caesalpinia by spines. In Sindora resinous globules are excreted. The number of seeds ranges from many to one; the funiculus varies also considerably, from straight to curved, contorted or hooked. An aril is known to be present in c. 20 genera.<br/>
Corner (1951, 1976) stated that the leguminous seed, in some cases, enlarges and fills the seed-cavity of the pod without differentiation of the features of the leguminous testa. Such seeds conform with the size of the pod and have the nature of tumours. Corner referred to them as 'overgrown seeds'. He found that such seeds also occur in some genera of the Caesalpiniaceae, for example, Bauhinia (p.p.), Brownea, Cynometra, Dialium, Koompassia, and Saraca.<br/>
A pleurogram is found in four genera, of which only Senna occurs in Malesia; this is a marked difference from the Mimosaceae where 60% of the genera are provided with a pleurogram. The fracture lines along the outer edge of Erythrophloeum may look like a pleurogram. Pseudopleurograms are present in Lysidice and Tamarindus. Winged seeds are found in two genera, none of which are present in Malesia.<br/>
The hilum is a simple, unspecialized structure compared with the papilionoid hilum, and can be described as punctiform and of little diagnostic value. The lens, however, varies to some extent and is of some taxonomic importance. Endosperm is found perhaps in half the genera of the Caesalpiniaceae but most commonly in genera in the tribes Caesalpinieae, Cassieae, and Cercideae while it is more rare in the Detarieae and Am- herstieae. The radicle is straight to deflexed and not concealed by the cotyledons. Keys to fruits and seeds are found in Gunn (1991).

				<heading>VEGETATIVE ANATOMY</heading>
				<string>One of the characteristics of the Leguminosae is the root nodule caused by fungal symbiosis. With few exceptions nodulation is the rule in the Mimosaceae and Papilionaceae, it is rare within the Caesalpiniaceae. Our knowledge is still limited and some results are contradictory. In two genera, however, nodules have been induced experimentally, i.e. Chamaecrista and Erythrophleum; it has also been induced in Swartzia, a genus now placed in the Papilionaceae, but formerly in the Caesalpiniaceae. Erythrophleum is also a 'marginal' genus or, as Corby (1981) expressed it "lies near the vague border between Mimosoideae and Caesalpinioideae." This leaves us with Chamaecrista, and the occurrence of root nodules here is also one of the characters that Irwin &amp; Barneby (1981) have used to support the separation of this group from Cassia.<br/>
The epidermis is often papillose and sometimes mucilaginous. Stomata structure is diverse, two main types are found, paracytic and anomocytic. Tanniniferous cells are common in the cortex and phloem. Secretory cavities and canals sometimes occur. The vascular bundles of the leaf veins are often accompanied by sclerenchyma. Solitary and clustered crystals can be found in all parts of the plants; cluster crystals are particularly characteristic of the mesophyl and thus differentiate the Caesalpiniaceae from the Papilionaceae and Mimosaceae. The pericycle of the young stem nearly always contains a continuous ring of sclerenchyma, or a continuous ring of fibres. Grooved stems occur in some species of Bauhinia, Cassia and Senna. In Bauhinia the stems of the lianas are sometimes flattened, forming 'monkey ladders'. Anomalous thickening is another characteristic feature of the lianas in Bauhinia', this includes types with successive growth rings and segmented xylem.<br/>
The wood anatomy is best known for the many valuable timber trees (Ilic 1991; Quirk 1983; Sudo 1988, 1991). Generally the wood is characterized by few specialized characters. Baretta-Kuypers (1981), in her survey of the wood anatomy of the family concludes further that the Caesalpiniaceae and the Papilionaceae anatomically merge into each other, while the Mimosaceae, on the other hand, seem to be quite distinct in their wood anatomy.<br/>
Below family level the wood structures usually provide good diagnostic characters, which often agree well with the groups based on the morphology. Two groups may be distinguished on the basis of ray features as well as parenchyma characteristics: 1) Caesalpinieae, Cassieae and Cercideae; 2) Detarieae and Amherstieae. In the first group the rays are mostly homocellular, in the second they are predominantly heterocellular.

				<string>The pollen morphology of the Caesalpiniaceae has been relatively well-studied. However, most of the literature (see Tissot 1990) consists of pollen-floristic contributions, each of which describes few species from a more or less limited area only. The treatment of the Caesalpiniaceae from Madagascar by Senesse (1980) is one of the few more extensive regional accounts, providing many detailed light and scanning electron micrographs. The surveys by Graham &amp; Barker (1981) and Ferguson (1987), scanning and transmission electron microscopical studies respectively, constitute together a comprehensive treatment of the whole family.<br/>
The Caesalpiniaceae are distinctly eurypalynous. The most widespread pollen type, found in all tribes and representing a general and comparatively unspecialized angio- spermous type, is the tricolporate, small- to medium-sized monad with perforate to reticulate ornamentation, and an exine consisting of a well-developed endexine and foot layer, a distinct columellate infratectum and relatively thick tectum. However, distinctive specializations also occur in all tribes, especially in the Cercideae (Bauhinia), Detarieae and Amherstieae, involving aperture as well as exine features. A mixed columellate/granular infratectum occurs randomly throughout the family. Pollen in permanent tetrads is found in three genera in widely separated tribes (Ferguson &amp; Banks 1994; see below).<br/>
In the tribe Caesalpinieae a number of genera is characterized by small colpi which are surrounded by a broad membranaceous margo (margocolpus) that sometimes extends to the poles (synmargocolpus). Coarsely reticulate ornamentation is found in Arapatiella, Arcoa, Chidlowia and Delonix, often associated with short or indistinct ectoapertures. All species of Diptychandra have acalymate tetrads, while those of Jacqueshuberia have thread-like structures connecting large (c. 80 &#181;m) monads with highly sinuous muri (see also Patel et al. 1985). Several representatives of the tribe have minute holes (foramina) within their ectexine.<br/>
Most genera of the tribe Cassieae have the general pollen type of the family. The genus Koompassia and one Dialium species have a striate exine. Ceratonia has tricol- porate as well as tetracolporate species. Pollen of Duparquetia may be unique in the angiosperms in having two polar pores (one distal, the other proximal) in a meridional circular colpus.<br/>
The genera of the tribe Cercideae possess the general pollen type. However, the genus Bauhinia is extremely diverse, showing also features as large (up to 120 &#181;m) grains, 5-7-colporate or -porate aperture system, inaperturate grains, a mixed columellate/granular or nearly completely granular infratectum, and striate, verrucate, gemmate to echi- nate ornamentation (see e.g. Larsen 1975; Ferguson &amp; Pearce 1986; Ferguson 1990). Calymate and acalymate tetrads occur in B. phoenicia and B. pottsii, respectively.<br/>
The Detarieae is palynologically the most diverse and complex tribe. The commonest pollen type, often with large conspicuous endoapertures, shows a wide range of inter- grading ornamentation types. Eperua has triangular, &#177;brevicolporate pollen. Pantoporate pollen occurs in Hardwickia (scabrate) and Colophospermum (reticulate). Syncolporate pollen is found in Baikiaea, and some Afzelia species have acalymate tetrads.<br/>
Pollen of the tribe Amherstieae is tricolporate and usually striate. Polystemonanthus pollen is &#177; perforate with psilate margos. Brachystegia has large (c. 80 &#181;m) coarsely reticulate pollen with finely reticulate poles. Both Detarieae and Amherstieae show a trend towards loss of the foot layer.<br/>
Special modes of pollination may in several cases explain resemblances in ornamentation in not closely related taxa. For instance, large pollen grains with conspicuous supratectal verrucae may be associated with bat pollination in Dicymbe (Amherstieae), Bauhinia (Cercideae) and several genera belonging to the Detarieae. Tetrads and viscin threads might be adaptations promoting multiple fertilization. The two related genera Hardwickia and Colophospermum are supposed to have wind pollination, which may be associated with the pantoporate, thin-walled morphology of the exine.<br/>
The oldest fossil Caesalpiniaceae pollen, the Sindora type (Detarieae), dates from the Maastrichtian of Siberia, and many records from the Tertiary are known (Muller 1981; Herendeen et al. 1992): Crudia type, Maniltoa grandiflora type, Caesalpinia type, Brachystegia type, Eperua type and Cassia type. From this palynological evidence it appears that by the lower Eocene the tribes Caesalpinieae, Detarieae and Amherstieae are known to have been present.

				<heading>CYTOLOGY</heading>
				<string>About half of the genera in the Caesalpiniaceae have been studied cytologically with regard to the chromosome numbers. Two major groups emerge, corresponding well with the current overall classification. The first group include the tribes Caesalpinieae, Cassieae and Cercideae with basic number x = 7 or 14; there are exceptions as, e.g., Acrocarpus, Pterolobium and Erythrophleum with x = 12 and in Cassia sensu lato, where the chromosome cytology is quite complex with a high degree of polyploidy and aneuploidy. In Chamaecrista x = 7 and 8 have been found, probably due to derived de- scending aneuploidy from ancestors with x = 14. In Bauhinia, where more than 50 spe- cies have been studied, most are diploid with 2n = 28, some are polyploid and some have deviating numbers, e.g. 2n = 26, found in several species in Asia and Australia. Diploidy is only found in Cercis with 2n = 14.<br/>
The second group, comprising the tribes Detarieae and Amherstieae, has mostly the basic number x = 12.<br/>
Several old chromosome counts have shown to be erroneous and in most cases where the basic number x = 8 has been suggested previously this has been shown to be incorrect. Much work has yet to be done before a clear pattern of the cytological condi- tions is established.

					<subHeading>Storage products of seeds</subHeading>Mature seeds of Caesalpiniaceae lack starch or contain only small starch grains (Smith 1983; Hegnauer &amp; Grayer-Barkmeijer 1993). Carbo- hydrates other than starch (reserve celluloses; oligosaccharides) and proteins are the main storage products of caesalpinioid seeds. Sometimes appreciable amounts of tri- glycerides (fatty oils: see later) are also present. Reserve celluloses are of two types. Amherstieae and Detarieae deposit the heteropolysaccharide amyloid in the cell walls of their large cotyledons. Seeds of many Caesalpinieae, Cassieae and Cercideae are copi- ously provided with an endosperm of thick-walled cells which store galactomannans. This galactomannan character is known from all three legume families and is of eco- nomic importance (Locust Bean Gum; Guar Gum). Besides carbohydrates, seeds of all Leguminosae contain large amounts of proteins which are reserve substances (e.g. legumins, vicilins), but may combine other functions with their role as N-containing storage products (see p. 16 of the Mimosaceae-treatment). Storage proteins of seeds are deposited in the so-called protein bodies which occur in practically all cells of the embryo (Smith 1983) and in cells of the endosperm. Seeds of all Leguminosae also contain triglycerides (fatty oils), but their amounts vary widely. Lipid contents and composition of seeds of Caesalpiniaceae were studied by many authors. As a rule triglycerides form the largest part of caesalpiniaceous seed lipids and lipid contents vary between 2% and 30%, but contents surmounting 10% are rare in this taxon, if the genus Bauhinia (12-20%; 5 species investigated) is excluded. Fatty acid profiles of seed oils are characteristic of certain genera, but there does not exist a distinct pattern for Caesalpiniaceae as a whole. Seed oils of Bauhinia contain 16:0, 18:0, 18:1 and 18:2 as predominant fatty acids. Oils of seeds of Afzelia (inclusive of Pahudia) contain large amounts of crepenynic and dehydrocrepenynic acids and minor amounts of arachidic, behenic and lignoceric acids (20:0, 22:0, 24:0). The Cassia seed oils hitherto investigated have 16:0, 18:1 and 18:2 as predominant fatty acids, but in Cassia grandis and Senna (Cassia) siamea oils the presence of minor amounts of the Halphen-positive cyclopropenoid sterculic and malvalic acids was detected. The same unusual fatty acids also occur in the seed oils ofDelonix regia and the papilionoid taxon Crotalaria retusa. Leguminous seeds also store mono- and oligosaccharides, inositols and non-proteinogenic amino acids. Inositols and nonprotein amino acids will be treated later. The characteristic oligosac- i harides of Leguminosae are raffinose, stachyose and verbascose, i.e. representatives of the so-called raffinose-stachyose series of sucrose-a-galactosides. The raffinose- stachyose sugars occur in seeds of most leguminous plants, but are usually lacking in their vegetative parts. The stachyose sugars are rapidly metabolized during early stages Of germination. This is the reason why sprouts of soya, alfalfa and other grain legumes are usually more wholesome than ungerminated seeds which often produce flatulence on account of interactions between intestinal bacteria and the indigestible sucrose-a- galactosides.<br/>
					<subHeading>Leaf proteins and proteins of vegetative storage organs</subHeading>Legumes have relatively protein-rich leaves. Because legumes and grasses are most important fodder plants, their leaf proteins were often studied. There seem to exist characteristic quantitative differences between the composition of leaf proteins of the two families. Legume leaf proteins contain larger amounts of arginine, aspartic acid, histidine, phenylalanine and pro- fine, and lesser amounts of alanine and serine. Within Leguminosae leaf proteins of Caesalpiniaceae are similar to those of Papilionaceae, but seem to differ from those of Mimosaceae by being poorer in glutamic acid and histidine and richer in aspartic acid, j3henylalanine and threonine (Yeoh et al. 1984, 1992). Roots and tubers of legumes contain much more protein than similar food plant products, such as batatas, manioc, potatoes and yams. Roots of Bauhinia esculenta, e.g., contain about 8.5% of crude protein, dry weight (= about 1.5% of fresh weight).<br/>
					<subHeading>Inositols (= cyclitols)</subHeading>Most Leguminosae synthesize and store methyl ethers of Lyclitols in leaves and seeds. Pinitol and several pinitol galactosides occur in a large number of species of all three legume families. In some taxa pinitol is replaced or accompanied by other methyl ethers, such as bornesitol and ononitol. Bornesitol and ononitol are monomethyl ethers of myoinositol, and pinitol is a monomethyl ether of (+)-chiro-inositol. Ononitol was also isolated from leaves of Senna (Cassia) obtusifolia (Matsuura et al. 1978). Leguminosae synthesize pinitol by epimerisation of ononitol (Dittrich &amp; Brandl 1987). Inositols and their methyl ethers belong to the so-called 'compatible solutes', i.e. water-soluble metabolites, which can be rapidly produced if there is a need to enhance the osmotic potential of the cells; 'compatible solutes' do not affect enzyme activities, even if they are present in the cells in high concentrations. Pinitol and related cyclitols seem to be involved in adaptation to arid conditions in many leguminous taxa.<br/>
					<subHeading>Organic acids</subHeading>Most Leguminosae accumulate large amounts of organic acids and, to some extent, acid profiles seem to be more or less taxon-characteristic. Malonic acid, e.g., is present in rather large amounts in green parts and seedlings of many Papilionaceae, but such an accumulation seems to be rare or totally lacking in Caesalpiniaceae and Mimosaceae. It must be admitted, however, that acid metabolism of Caesalpiniaceae is not well known. There are two exceptions to this statement. (+)-Tartaric acid and tartrates are stored in large amounts in leaves and fruits of Tamarindus indica, and the African Bauhinia (Piliostigma) reticulata produces (-)-tartaric acid which is accumulated as free acid and as tartrates in leaves and fruits. Tartaric acid is also present in appreciable amounts in leaves of Bauhinia (Piliostigma) malabarica, and was isolated from leaves of Senna obtusifolia (Matsuura et al. 1978). For chelidonic acid see sub turgorins of nyc- tinastic plants.<br/>
					<subHeading>Gummi arabicum-type mucilages</subHeading>A number of woody legumes shows the phenomenon known as gummosis, that is, they exude plenty of acidic mucilages after stress (e.g. traumata caused by animals, man, wind and extreme drought). This phenomenon was best studied with mimosoids which yield a number of economically important gum exudates, such as 'Gummi arabicum' (see p. 18 of the Mimosaceae-treaiment). These acidic gum exudates contain taxon-characteristic amounts of proteins; in fact they are proteoglycanes of glycoproteins. Compared with mimosoids, caesalpinioids are rather poor producers of gum exudates. Moreover, their gum exudates differ chemically in several respects from those of most hitherto investigated mimosoid traumatogenic mucilages. Analytical data are available for gum exudates of Brachystegia glaucescens and B. spiciformis, Caesalpinia eriostachya and two other American Caesalpinia-taxa, Cassia grandis and Senna nicaraguensis, Cercidium praecox and Julbernardia globiflora. Protein contents of these gums varied between 0.8 and 10.6%, and the composition of the protein component of these exudates was variable; depending on the taxon glycine, lysine, serine, threonine, proline and/or hydroxyproline were among the predominant amino acids generated on protein hydrolysis. The heteropolysaccharide component of caesalpinioid gum exudates is also rather variable. 4-O-Methylglucuronic acid, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, galactose, rhamnose, arabinose and/or xylose are present in highly variable proportions as building stones of these polysaccharides. However, the number of caesalpinioid species which have carefully analysed gum exudates is too small for taxonomic purposes. Acidic mucilages are also deposited in certain cells of the epidermata of leaves and stems by many leguminous taxa. The distribution of such mucilages was studied by Solereder and his associates by making use of anatomical tech- niques. Chemical analyses of such leaf mucilage are scarce. Leaves of Senna alexan- drina (= Cassia angustifolia) were shown to yield 2.5% (dry weight) of crude mucilage containing nearly equimolecular proportion (c. 20 mole % each) of galacturonic acid, rhamnose and galactose and about 30 mole % arabinose, 5 mole % glucose and a little mannose (Muller er al. 1989).<br/>
					<subHeading>Flavonoids</subHeading>Flavonoid metabolism of legumes was recently discussed by Heg- nauer &amp; Grayer-Barkmeijer (1993); see also pp. 19-20 of the Mimosaceae-treatment. Flavonols and flavones with the most usual hydroxylation patterns (3,5,7,3'[4'] and 5,7,3'[4']) are common in all three legume families. They usually occur as glycosides and may have one to several of their hydroxyls methylated. Myricetin-type flavonols (trihydroxylated B-ring) occur in all three families, but are perhaps somewhat more frequent in caesalpinioids than in the other two main taxa. Additional hydroxyls in po- sition 6, 8 and 2' are by no means rare; such highly hydroxylated flavonoids are known from all three legume families. The most characteristic legume flavonoids are isoflavon-: oids in the wide sense, prenylated flavonoids and 5-deoxyflavonoids. These three types are mainly, but not totally, restricted to Papilionaceae. Examples of their occurrence in Caesalpiniaceae are the isoflavonoid pterocarpan leiocarpin from the bark of Apuleia leiocarpa (Braz Filho &amp; Gottlieb 1971) and the assumedly isoprenylated torosa-flavone-C from leaves of Cassia torosa Cav. (Kitanaka et al. 1991). The last-mentioned name prob- ably represents a form of Senna sophera (L.) Roxb.; the plant, probably of Chinese ori- gin, was cultivated in the Medicinal Plant Garden of Nihon University. The isoprenyl- ated anthraquinone from seeds of Cassia marginata auct. non Willd. (= C. roxburghii DC.) (Gupta et al. 1989) and the prenylated dihydrostilbene derivative racemosol from the heartwood of Bauhinia racemosa collected in the Paderu area of the Araku Valley (India) (Anjaneyulu et al. 1986) yielded an additional proof of the occurrence of prenyl- ation of aromatic rings in Caesalpiniaceae. C-Methylation of flavonoids is known from Senna (Cassia) occidentalis\ the 7-rhamnosides of two unusual aglyca, matteucinol (= 5,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxy-6,8-dimethylflavanone) and jaceidin (= 5,7,4-trihydroxy- 3,6,3'-trimethoxyflavone), were isolated from its leaves (Tiwari &amp; Singh 1977). Syn- thesis of 5-deoxyflavonoids in Caesalpiniaceae is illustrated by Bauhinia manca (Achen- bach et al. 1988) and Cassia fistula (Morimoto et al. 1988). Stems of B. manca yielded liquiritigenin and related chalcones and corresponding flavanones, such as isoliquiritigenin (= 7,4'-dihydroxyflavanone), and leaves of C. fistula contain dimeric flavanoids which have a 7,4'-dihydroxyflavan unit. Rotenoids are isoflavone derived isoflavon- oids with a Ci6~skeleton; they seem to be restricted in Leguminosae to a number of genera of Papilionaceae. Caesalpinioids and mimosoids produce flavon and flavanone analogues of rotenoids, the so-called peltogynoids (see p. 20 of the Mimosaceae-treat- ment). Peltogynoids occur in the caesalpinioid genera Distemonanthus, Goniorrhachis and Peltogyne. To complete this brief sketch of flavonoid profiles of Caesalpiniaceae it | should be mentioned that leaves of Bauhinia vahlii yielded agathisflavon (= 6-8"-biapigenin) derivatives (Sultana et al. 1985) and that flavon-C-glycosides occur frequently in caesalpinioids. Occurrence of the latter may be illustrated by vitexin in leaves of Senna (Cassia) occidentalis (Anton &amp; Duquenois 1968), the torosaflavones-A and -B and the 3'-glucoside of B in leaves of Cassia torosa (= Senna sophera, see above) (Kitanaka et al. 1989, 1992) and schaftoside and isoschaftoside and their 4'-glucosides in cotyledons of Ceratonia siliqua (Batista &amp; Gomes 1993).<br/>
					<subHeading>Stilbenoids and xanthones</subHeading>Most of the naturally occurring stilbenoids (stilbenes, dihydrostilbenes <annotation>[= dibenzyls]</annotation>, dihydrophenanthrenes) and xanthones (those hydroxyl- ated in the 1- and 3-position) are biosynthetically intimately related with flavonoids. Xanthones of this type are rare in Leguminosae with the exception of mangiferin of the papilionoid genus Hedysarum. Another such-like xanthone is the 4-rhamnoglucoside of l,4,8-trihydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyxanthone which was isolated from the bark of Cassia fistula (Gupta et al. 1989). Stilbenoids, however, seem to occur frequently in woods; they were detected in members of Caesalpinieae, Cassieae, Cercideae and Detarieae, and are often present in appreciable amounts. The already mentioned Bauhinia racemosa and some species of Cassia s.l. will be used to illustrate stilbene metabolism of Caesalpiniaceae. A wood sample of B. racemosa collected in another site of the same Indian Valley yielded resveratrol and pacharin, a new dihydrostilbene derivative, instead of racemosol (Anjaneyulu et al. 1984). Several stilbene derivatives were isolated from woods of Senna (Cassia) didymobotrya (Delle Monache et al. 1991: O-methyl derivatives of 3,4,3',5' <annotation>[= 3,5,3',4']</annotation>-tetrahydroxystilbene), S. dentata (Oliveira et al. 1977: resveratrol and 3,4,3',5'-tetrahydroxystilbene), Chamaecrista garrettiana (Hata et al. 1979: 3,4,3',5'- tetrahydroxystilbene and the corresponding dihydrostilbene and dihydrophenanthrene and related stilbenoids; Baba et al. 1988, 1992: tetrahydroxystilbene dimers, the cassi- garols A to D), Cassia marginata auct. (= Cassia roxburghii) (Rao &amp; Rajadurai 1968: 3,4,3',5'-tetrahydroxystilbene), Senna macranthera (Cassia pudibunda) (Messana et al. 1991: 4-0-methyl-3,4,5,3',5'-pentahydroxystilbene from roots) and Cassia roxburghii (Ashok &amp; Sarma 1987: roxburghin, a new tetrahydroxystilbene; N.B.: roxburghin is also the name given to a rubiaceous alkaloid). Other sources of tetra- and pentahydroxy- stilbenes are woods of Vouacapoua americana and V. macropetala (Caesalpinieae) and Intsia bijuga, I. palembanica and Schotia brachypetala (Detarieae). It should be mentioned that the 3,4,3',5' (= 3,5,3',4')-tetrahydroxystilbene is often called piceatannol in literature; this is an error, however, because this stilbene is different from Grassmann's piceatannol isolated from the soft bark of Picea abies (Grassmann &amp; Endres 1965).<br/>
					<subHeading>Tannins</subHeading>Tannins were already discussed shortly in the Mimosaceae-treatment. They are widespread in Leguminosae, but largest amounts are present in roots, stems and fruits of woody plants of (sub)tropical regions. Caesalpiniaceae yielded tannin materials which were of economic importance formerly, i.e. the dried fruits of some South American and Indian Caesalpinia species: Caesalpinia coriaria yields 'Divi-divi', C. bre- vifolia yields 'Algar(r)obilla', C. spinosa yields 'Tara' or 'Guarango' and C. digyna yields the Indian crude drug 'Teri' or 'Tari' (Howes 1952; Stant 1972). All these tanning materials contain gallotannins, but in 'Divi-divi' and 'Algarobilla' ellagitannins predominate. It deserves mentioning that bergenin and several of its derivatives have been isolated from different parts of caesalpinioid taxa: roots of Caesalpinia digyna and Wagatea spicata, flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum, wood and bark of Peltophorum africanum. 'Avram bark', derived from Cassia auriculata, is another commercially available caesalpinioid tanning material; it contains condensed tannins which have not yet been studied in detail.<br/>
					<subHeading>Non-protein(ogenic) amino acids</subHeading>One of the striking phytochemical characters of many leguminous taxa is storage of large amounts of free amino acids, chiefly in seeds, but sometimes also in leaves and stems. These amino acids may be common proteino- genic acids. More often such storage products are more or less toxic non-protein amino acids, such as canavanine (restricted to some papilionoid tribes) and mimosine (occurring mainly in some Mimosaceae). The profiles of such amino acids are often taxonomi- cally useful at generic and/or tribal levels. Some examples were chosen to illustrate this fact for a number of caesalpinioid genera. All members of the small genus Griffonia (= Bandeirea), i.e. G. simplicifolia, physocarpa and G. speciosa, store large amounts of 5-hydroxytryptophan in their seeds which are therefore very toxic to many insects (Bell et al. 1976). Shewry &amp; Fowden (1976) investigated seeds of four African genera of Amherstieae. Julbernardia globiflora and J. paniculata had an amino acid profile dominated by y-methylene glutamic acid and a 4,5-trans-isomer of 4,5-dihydroxypipecolic acid; Cryptosepalum exfoliatum and C. maraviense had y-methylene glutamic acid and y-methylene glutamine as main amino acids; in seeds of Isoberlinia angolensis and I. tomentosa only pipecolic, trans-5-hydroxypipecolic and another trans-isomer of 4,5- dihydroxypipecolic acids were observed; seeds of 7 species and one hybrid of Br achy- stegia had pipecolic and trans-5-hydroxypipecolic acids as main free amino acids; some of them also contained minor to medium amounts of trans-4-hydroxypipecolic acid and of one dihydroxypipecolic acid, and all contained additionally some y-methylene glutamic acid. Remarkable observations were made with three African and a Ceylonese species of Dialium (Peiris &amp; Seneviratne 1977); seeds of all four species were shown to contain over 2% of albizziine, an amino acid hitherto only known from Mimosaceae. Evans &amp; Bell (1978) published a survey of profiles of free amino acids in seeds of Caesalpinieae; perhaps the most striking result was the demonstration of azetidine-2- carboxylic acid and 3-hydroxyproline as predominant free amino acids in seeds of all three species of Bussea, B. gossweileri, B. massaiensis and B. occidentalis. It is perhaps adequate to mention at this point a biosynthetically still mysterious group of non- cyanogenic cyanoglucosides having a cyclohexane or cyclohex-2-ene ring bearing a cyanomethylene substituent in 1-position and two to four hydroxyls in positions 4, 5 and 6, and sometimes 2. Such a glucoside was isolated in 1955 from roots of Litho- spermum purpureocoeruleum (= Buglossoides purpureocoeruleum, Boraginaceae) and called lithospermoside when its structure was elucidated in 1977 by Sosa et al. The same glucoside was isolated by Plouvier from leaves and bark of Cercis siliquastrum during his cyclitol research and identified with lithospermoside in 1978. In the meantime Dwuma- Badu et al. (1976) had isolated besides 5-hydroxytryptophan a similar nitrile glucoside, griffonin, and its modified aglycone, griffonolide, from roots of Griffonia simplicifolia. Griffonin was later identified with lithospermoside. The 4-methylether of lithospermoside, called bauhinin, was isolated from roots of Bauhinia championii from Taiwan (Chen et al. 1985), and bark of Bauhinia (Piliostigma) thonningii from Nigeria yielded griffonolide (Okwute et al. 1986). Lithospermoside-type non-cyanogenic cyano-com- pounds occur erratically in dicotyledonous plants; they are also known from Aquifolia- ceae, Lauraceae, Menispermaceae, Ochnaceae, Ranunculaceae, and Simmondsiaceae. For discussions of structures and stereochemistry of lithospermoside-type glucosides and their modified aglyca, see Yogo et al. (1990) and Murakami et al. (1993). As far as is known at present this type of glucosides is restricted in Leguminosae to the tribe Cercideae (Bauhinia p.p., Cercis p.p.) and is by no means ubiquitous in the taxa mentioned. Plouvier (1978) failed to trace lithospermoside in leaves and barks of Bauhinia aurea, B. purpurea, Cercis canadensis and C. chinensis.<br/>
					<subHeading>Alkaloids</subHeading>See also p. 21-22 of the Mimosaceae-treatment. True alkaloids are rather rare in Caesalpiniaceae with the exception of Cynometra and perhaps Senna. Four West African species of Cynometra, C. ananta, C. hankei, C. lujae and C. mannii, were investigated for the presence of alkaloids; histamine-derived alkaloids, such as anantine and cynometrine, are present in the first-mentioned three species, but seem to be lacking in C. mannii (Waterman &amp; Faulkner 1981; Tchissambou et al. 1982). Several species of Cassia are mentioned in literature as producing 2,6-dialkylsubstituted piperidine alkaloids of the type already mentioned for Prosopis sub Mimosaceae. Accurate inspection of the data published shows that all taxa investigated belong to varieties of a single species, Senna spectabilis; about 8, probably acetogenic, piperidine alkaloids, have been isolated from these taxa (Struntz &amp; Findlay 1985). The isoquinolone alkaloids siamine and siaminine A and B from seeds and leaves of Senna (Cassia) siamea probably also represent acetogenins (El-Sayyad 1984); the same holds for the chromone alkaloid cas- siadinine isolated from its flowers (Biswas &amp; Malik 1986); from a biogenetic point of view all four compounds can be considered to be basic penta- to heptaketides. Leaves of Senna septemtrionalis (= Cassia floribunda) yielded 0.36% of N,N-dibenzoylspermi- dine (Alemayehu et al. 1988). We cannot leave caesalpinioid alkaloids without mentioning two different types of basic terpenoids. Chamaecrista (Cassia) absus yielded long ago chaksine; its structure was revised recently (Voelter et al. 1985) to a dimeric, macro- cyclic monoterpene dilactone combined with two mols of guanidine. All species of Erythrophleum seem to produce basic cassane-type diterpenes which are known as Erythrophleum alkaloids and represent the toxic constituents of this genus (Collins et al. 1990). The claim that seeds, flowers and bark of Senna (Cassia) auriculata contain nephrotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids is in need of confirmation, because the analytical methods used (Arseculeratne et al. 1981) are somewhat questionable.<br/>
					<subHeading>Diterpenes and balsams (= oleoresins)</subHeading>'Balsam copaiba' is the best known oleo- resin produced by caesalpinioid taxa (Guenther 1952); it is deposited in excretory canals and cavities, which are rather common in stems, leaves and fruits of a number of Detarieae. True 'balsam copaiba' is produced by members of the South American genus Co- paifera and consists of a mixture of mainly acidic diterpenes and volatile sesquiterpenes. 'Copals' are solidified oleoresins of conifers and legumes of the tribe Detarieae. This process of solidification involves evaporation of volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes and polymerisations of unsaturated diterpenoids. Diterpenes, however, are by no means restricted to excretory cavities in Leguminosae. They may be deposited everywhere in a plant, e.g. roots, stems, leaves, seeds. Tllurin balsam' or 'African copaiba balsam' and 'African copals' are produced by species of Daniellia, Detarium, Gossweilerodendron, Oxystigma, Trachylobium, and other Detarieae. The Indian Kingiodendron pinnatum (= Hardwickia pinnata) yields a similar balsam which is also used medicinally and technically <annotation>[<references>

						</references>]</annotation>. Woods of South American species of Eperua yield similar oleoresins consisting of volatile sesquiterpenes and non-volatile diterpene acids. The two genera Copaifera and Hymenaea have large excretory cavities in leaves and pods besides their excretory canals in stems; their volatile leaf contents are chemically similar and consist mainly of caryophyllene-, copaene-, humulene- and selinene- type sesquiterpene hydrocarbons; selection pressures seem to govern the composition of the volatile part of leaf oleoresins of individual populations and species (Langenheim 1981; Arrhenius &amp; Langenheim 1983; Arrhenius et al. 1983). The chemistry of the acidic and neutral diterpenoids of Detarieae varies widely. This is exemplified by bicyclic lab- dane-type deterpenoids, such as copalic, daniellic and eperuic acids, bicyclic clerodane- type diterpenoids such as hardwickiic, kolavic, kolavenic and kolavenolic acids, tetracyclic kaurenic acids and pentacyclic trachylobanic acid. Often different parts seem to produce their own chemical oleoresin profiles. This has been shown for stem exudates, leaf pocket and seed pod oleoresins of Trachylobium verrucosum and several Hymenaea taxa (Khoo et al. 1973). Labdane- and clerodane-type diterpenes seem to be most characteristic of Leguminosae. Caesalpinioids also yielded rearranged labdanes (methyl migration from 10- to 9-position) (Khoo et al. 1973) and 2,3-secomanoyl oxide derivatives, such as colensenone and colensanone from leaves of Senna (Cassia) petersiana (Msonthi 1984). For cassane-type diterpenes which seem to be relatively characteristic of Caesalpiniaceae see the Mimosaceae-treatment. Recent additions to cassane-chemistry are the chamaetexanins from roots of Chamaecrista flexuosa var. texana (= Cassia texana) (Barba et al. 1992).<br/>
					<subHeading>Triterpenes and saponins</subHeading>These classes of constituents are of rather common occurrence in leguminous plants. They were considered in some detail in the Mimosaceae- treatment. Free triterpenes are deposited probably in caesalpinioids as frequently in woods and barks as in the two other (sub)families. As an example the isolation of lupeol, lupe- none and betulinic acid from bark of Melanoxylon brauna may be mentioned (Gottlieb et al. 1971). Saponins seem to be stored in large quantities less frequently by caesalpinioids than by mimosoids and papilionoids. This difference, however, may be rather artificial, because caesalpinioids were less intensely studied for saponins. Available evidence suggests that oleanene-type triterpenic acids are main sapogenins in Caesalpiniaceae: oleanolic acid (Mora gongrijpii), morolic acid (Mora excels a), echinocystic acid (Gleditsia fera Merr., G. chinensis Lam., G. japonica Miq., G. triacanthos L.) and 2p,23-dihydroxyacacic acid <annotation>[Gymnocladus dioica (L.) Koch and G. chinensis Baill.]</annotation>. Konoshima et al. (1981) described two chemodemes of Gleditsia japonica in Japan; one has practically saponin-free pods and the other, called chemodeme 'Saponifera' produces pods used medicinally and containing large amounts of mono-, bis- and trisdesmosidic saponins. Such intraspecific chemical variability in secondary constituents is perhaps more common in Leguminosae than is usually assumed. The Gleditsia and Gymnocladus saponins have highly complex structures; their sugar parts are acylated by one to several molecules of hydroxymonoterpenic acids; in this respect these saponins are similar to the Entada saponins mentioned in the Mimosaceae-treatment.<br/>
					<subHeading>Other secondary compounds oftaxonomic significance</subHeading>Many other types of secondary metabolites occur erratically. A few caesalpinioids were reported to be weakly cyanogenic, but hitherto no cyanogenic compounds have been isolated from members of this taxon. One biogenetic class, the chrysophanol-rhein-type anthraquinones, deserves special attention. Such quinonoid constituents are responsible for many biological properties and medicinal and technical uses of the respective taxa; moreover they yield valuable taxonomic characters. Biogenetically chrysophanol-type anthraquinones are acetogenins (= polyketides); in fact they are octaketides and probably occur in every species of Cassia s.l. with many species-specific chemical profiles and localization patterns (roots, bark, wood, leaves, flowers, pods, seeds, seedlings). In Senna species these anthraquinones are accompanied by biogenetically related octaketides of non-quin- onoid nature, such as the xanthones pinselin (e.g., S. occidentalis) and cassiaxanthone («S. reticulata), the tetrahydroanthracenes like torosachrysone (e.g., Cassia torosa Cav. = Senna sophera) and germichrysone (e.g., S. occidentalis). Often these octaketides are also accompanied by heptaketides, such as tinnevellin-8-glucoside (S. angustifolia), tora- chrysone (S. tora), rubrofusarin and nor-rubrofusarin (e.g., seeds of S. tora). The structures of the already mentioned basic constituents of S. siamea, siamine and the sia- minines, suggest a pentaketide origin. Octaketidic anthraquinones were also isolated from wood and bark of Melanoxylon brauna (Gottlieb et al. 1971).<br/>
Phytoalexin-production has not yet been traced in Caesalpiniaceae.<br/>
					<subHeading>Nyctinastins (= nyctinastenes = turgorins)</subHeading>The chemistry of nastic leaf movements was already briefly discussed in the Mimosaceae-treatment. Many caesalpinioids also show periodical movements of folioli. Nastic movements are caused by turgor-changes in cells of the so-called pulvini (at base of petioles) and pulvinuli (at base of folioli). These turgor-changes are triggered by phytohormone-like chemicals. Japanese workers investigated Chamaecrista (Cassia) mimosoides, Senna (Cassia) occidentalis and S. (Cassia) tora and other leguminous taxa and found two factors which they believe to be specific turgorins of the Cassieae: potassium chelidonate was shown to be a leaflet-closing factor and potassium lespedezate and potassium isolespedezate (isolated from the papilio- noid plant Lespedeza cuneata) were shown to be specific leaflet-opening factors for all three species belonging to the Cassieae tested by them (Miyoshi et al. 1987; Shigemori et al. 1989, 1990). It is worth mentioning that chelidonic acid and its mono- and dimethyl esters are present in large amounts in flowers of Senna (Cassia) spectabilis and were shown to have antiallergic and weak antifeedant properties (Veera Mallaiah et al. 1980, 1984; Ashok &amp; Sarma 1988).<br/>
					<subHeading>Nodulation and symbiotic nitrogen-fixation</subHeading>See also the Mimosaceae-treatment for references. N2-Fixation is a key character of Leguminosae. It is connected with root- nodulation (seldom stem-nodulation) and symbiosis with different strains of Rhizobia.<br/>
In Caesalpiniaceae nodulation seems to be restricted mainly to Caesalpinieae p.p. and Cassieae p.p. and to be extremely rare in Cercideae, Detarieae and Amherstieae. Apparently many tropical woody legumes prefer symbiotic associations with fungi (mycorrhiza) to symbiosis with bacteria of the family Rhizobiaceae.<br/>
					<subHeading>Summary</subHeading>Summarizing the following statements seem to be appropriate:<br/>
a) In chemical respects Caesalpiniaceae are typical members of Leguminosae. As arguments their seed galactomannans, their seed sugars belonging to the raffinose series, production and accumulation of pinitol and related cyclitols, their proanthocyanidins, peltogynoid-type flavonoids with a C16-skeleton and their stilbenes, and the production and storage of non-protein amino acids in many of their taxa can be quoted.<br/>
b) Moreover, synthesis and accumulation of compounds of several classes of secondary metabolites yield characters which are taxonomically useful at the tribal and/or generic levels. In this respect saponins, oleoresins and the polyketide metabolites of Cassia s.l. deserve special attention.<br/>
c) Metabolic features which are characteristic of Caesalpiniaceae as a whole have not been traced hitherto, as far as I am aware.

				<string>The fundamental works on the Leguminosae are those of Bentham (1865) and Taubert (1894). Taubert divided the family into three subfamilies but commented that there are no sharp limits between them. Following Bentham he divided the Caesalpinioideae into eight tribes, again stating that this is in many ways an artificial division and that it is difficult to delimit the tribes as there are several transitional groups. Hutchinson (1964) divided Caesalpiniaceae into two subfamilies: Caesalpinioideae with small and often early caducous bracteoles (or if bracteoles larger then mostly petaloid) and Brachystegioideae with large, usually persistent bracteoles. Also in this system difficulties arise in placing several genera.<br/>
Later Cowan (1981) recognized five tribes within the Caesalpinioideae: Cercideae, Caesalpinieae, Cassieae, Detarieae and Amherstieae.<br/>
Recently Breteler (1995) studied the demarcation of Amherstieae and Detarieae and concluded that they should be united as one tribe under the name of Detarieae. He also added a new tribe, i.e. Macrolobieae.<br/>
The important characters for the recently delimited tribes and their Malesian genera (including introduced or cultivated ones) are listed below. For more details see Cowan (1981) and Breteler (1995).
<ol>
						<li>Cercideae Bronn — Many characters indicate that this probably is the most primitive tribe or, as Cowan (1981) suggests, an early offshoot of the Caesalpinioideae. The leaves are simple, bilobed or consisting of two free leaflets, palmately veined. A group of only 5 genera; in Malesia Bauhinia is the sole genus.</li>
						<li>Caesalpinieae Polhill &amp; Vidal — Stipules lateral or absent. Leaves are generally compound or, if consisting of a sole foliole, then pinnately veined. Hypanthium most often tubular or cupular. Stipules lateral or absent; bracteoles small or absent. The following Malesian genera belong here: Acrocarpus, Caesalpinia, Gleditsia, Pelthopho- rum, Pterolobium, Sympetalandra, and Delonix (introduced).</li>
						<li>Cassieae Bronn — Stipules lateral. Hypanthium absent or short and filled with secretory tissue. In Malesia the following genera occur: Cassia, Chamaecrista, Dialium, Kalappia, Koompassia, Senna, and Uittienia.</li>
						<li>Detarieae DC., following the redelimitation by Breteler (1995) — Bracteoles not always present and never protecting the flower bud till anthesis. The calyx always well developed. The following genera occur in Malesia: Afzelia, Amherstia, Brownea, Copaifera, Crudia, Cynometra, Endertia, Hymenaea, Intsia, Kingiodendron, Leuco- stegane, Maniltoa, Saraca, Sindora and Tamarindus.</li>
						<li>Macrolobieae Breteler — Important characters as published in the original description: Bracteoles valvate, often thick, covering the flower bud till anthesis, resembling a calyx, often persistent. Calyx usually reduced. Distributed in African and American tropics. No representative genera cultivated in Malesia.</li>

				<string>
					<subHeading>Anatomy</subHeading>The stem anatomy has been studied in several species and particular attention has been paid to the anomalous growth of several of the large lianas, some producing band-shaped, winged and undulated stems ('monkey-ladders', 'escada das macacos'), due to the cambium being confined to two opposed areas, e.g. B. scandens. In B. vahlii successive rings of growths are found and in, e.g., B. championi a cleft xylem mass is found and one or two successive rings of xylem and phloem; secondary bundles arise in the pith.

				<string>
					<subHeading>Taxonomy</subHeading>As this large genus comprises a wide range of life-forms from shrubs to trees and lianas and an unusual variation in flower structure some authors as, e.g., latest De Wit (1956) have found it evident to split it into several distinct genera. The present authors have studied the genus from all over its distribution area and found a reticulate pattern of variation. They have drawn the conclusion, now generally accepted among Legume-specialists, that Bauhinia in the sense of Linnaeus, Bentham, De Can- dolle, Taubert, and Hutchinson is an evolutionary unit and a very natural genus.<br/>
In the above only generic synonyms related to species occurring in the Malesian area have been mentioned. No less than 26 segregated genera have been created, see Wunderlin (1976) and Wunderlin, Larsen &amp; Larsen (1987).

			<feature class="pollination">
				<string>
					<subHeading>Pollination</subHeading>Little has been done to study the genus in nature. From Java (?) come reports on bat-pollination, which is also observed in S America. In several S American species bird-pollination has been observed, while the many medium- and small-flowered species with nectariferous discs probably are entomophilous. Butterfly pollination has been observed in some species in Thailand.

On the specimen from Sabah (Lahad Datu) the flowers are described as red. This is not observed in any other specimen in this group (i.e. Bauhinia semibifida, B. lingua, B. aherniana).

				<string>Two specimens from Sarawak, 1st Div., one in flower from Bau and one in fruit from Datu, are closely related to this species; the inflorescence, however, is shorter and the filaments glabrous; the fruiting specimen has 2 pods, rusty brown, c. 14 by 5 cm. A collection mentioned by de Wit (l.c.), Cuadra A 2130, from Kinabatangan-besar consists of leaves, old inflorescence axis and a very large, velutinous pod (not attached to the specimen!) of 40 by 8 cm. We have studied this material at K and SING (several sheets) and found that, even in spite of the very large pod, it undoubtedly belongs here.</string>

				<string>Bauhinia crudiantha is evidently a rare species not yet fully understood. It is closely related to B. endertii and B. fidva from which it mainly deviates in the inflorescence structure, the insertion of the bracteoles, the hypanthium, and the filament hairy in the lower part. De Wit (l.c.) suggests that it is close to B. ornata Kurz ('Phanera rufa Benth.'); this species, belonging to the northern hemispheric monsoon region, has only a superficial resemblance to B. crudiantha.</string>

				<string>This species is closely related to Bauhinia fulva; we have kept it at specific level as we find it fairly well distinguished by the small, more gracile floral structures, the hairy style and several quantitative characters. Only one specimen has a mature pod, a very old one; if the pod really is glabrous this is another good character distinguishing it from B. fidva.</string>
				<num>2</num>
				<string>In this species there is a wide variation in the indumentum of the leaves and inflorescences from densely hairy to almost glabrous. Also the shape of the leaves varies considerably. One specimen, Argent &amp; Coppins 1148 (AAU, E) from Mt Mulu has the leaves glabrous or nearly so and the tip of the lobes caudate; the inflorescence is almost glabrous, the flowers somewhat larger, and the style subglabrous. When more material from Mt Mulu is available, it may be established as a separate variety.</string>

				<string>Bauhinia excelsa is particularly polymorphous in the size and shape of the floral parts. De Wit (l.c.) writes that Merrill's Bauhinia megalantha cannot be maintained at species level, but may be kept as a variety of B. excelsa mainly on account of its larger flowers; this view has been even clearer with the more ample material we have had available. It is evident that there is a gradual variation in the size of the floral parts; furthermore the size of the sepals and petals of the type specimen of B. megalantha does hardly deviate from the size of the type of B. excelsa. On the other hand there are small- flowered specimens of B. excelsa showing some resemblance with B. semibifida, but the petals are always densely hairy on the outer side; their measures are given in parenthesis in the description above.</string>
				<num>2</num>
				<string>Petals may vary in colour from yellow to red (in different stages of development) or white with pink stripes; most plants, however, seem to have flower colours as indicated above.</string>

				<string>Bauhinia ferruginea is a well-defined species easily recognized by the unique character of the petals, first erect, then with recurved margins and finally the whole petal entirely curving downwards. Flower colours are by various collectors described from white or creamy turning yellowish, to pinkish. The petals are usually (always?) white to yellowish with age, the stamens pink to red and the anthers red.</string>
				<num>2</num>
				<string>We have found that the taxa 'ferruginea' and 'griffithiana' are difficult to distinguish; they are mainly based on presence or absence of stipules in herbarium material and on the colour of the indumentum. How much these characters are due to geographical and ecological conditions have still to be studied in nature. We have studied populations in southern Thailand of var.ferruginea and found that while the flowering branches shed the stipules, these were kept longer on young sterile shoots. Some collections from Penang (e. g. Potts s. n. in G) have smaller, ovate stipules on the tendrils, but apart from this we have not observed 'small falcate stipules' as mentioned by De Wit (l.c.). We have here chosen to maintain the two taxa as varieties as there are several examples that occur as transition forms; on the other hand, with our present knowledge, it seems that there is a difference in the distribution between var.ferruginea and var. griffithiana.</string>

					<subHeading>Note</subHeading>The type of Phanera bicornuta Miq. (U) consists of two sterile branches, some loose leaves, a loose pod and one seed. This specimen was treated by De Wit under Phanera bidentata as subsp. bicornuta. Nothing in the material, however, suggests that this specimen belongs there; most certainly it belongs to Bauhinia integrifolia, even Miquel writes in the protologue that it is close to Phanera polyantha (= Bauhinia integrifolia).</string>

					<subHeading>Note</subHeading>Bauhinia lingua is a very polymorphous species like B. semibifida and some of its variations approach B. aherniana. We have separated two varieties based on formerly proposed species but a number of other species described are less easy to maintain. It is evident that isolated populations to some extent have become recognizable. Thus small-flowered specimens from N Luzon have been dealt with as B. pinchotiana, similar appearance is found among collections from the Moluccas. Large-flowered plants from various localities in the central Philippines have been treated as B. warburgii; other large-flowered plants from Celebes have been described as B. minahassae. A collection from Butuan City, Philippines (.PNH 98205) with almost glabrous leaves and flower buds may represent a undescribed taxon; the material, however, has no fully developed flowers.<br/>
It is possible that, when a much larger amount of material is available and extensive field studies undertaken, some of these variations could be recognized formally; but at the present moment we find it safer to avoid further splitting.
Still Bauhinia lingua is most easily distinguished on its narrow tubular hypanthium, gradually tapering towards the pedicel.</string>

				<string>Both Merrill and De Wit regard this as a very distinct taxon and we fully agree even if only the type collection is known. We have studied the specimen in K and the characteristic leaves, the inflorescence axis and bud shape together with the broad, stout hypanthium are all very remarkable. One specimen from Balar, Quezon (Luzon) in floral characters agrees with this species; the leaves, however, on a sterile shoot are divided 2/3 and with acute lobes. The type locality now lies within the limits of Metropolitan Manila and is probably deprived of its original vegetation.</string>
				<num>2</num>
				<string>Quisumbing PNH 2458, also from Quezon, studied from SING, is a fruiting branch. The inflorescence axis and the hypanthium suggest this variety but the leaves are narrowly ovate, 5.5-7.5 by 4-5 cm, divided 2/3 with narrow sinus and narrow triangular lobes. This may represent a new variety.</string>

					<subHeading>Note</subHeading>This species apparently is rare and still needs further study to be fully under- stood. Merrill writes that it is closely related to Bauhinia warburgii, i.e. B. integrifolia var. cumingiana; we do not think this is the case, because not only the leaves are differ- ent but also the flower structure differs. De Wit, l.c., in his description cites two speci- mens, one from Prov. Tayabas and one from Rizal. We have hesitatingly emended the description and added a flowering specimen (Lagrimas 608 ) from Prov. Zambas; this plant has smaller floral parts and a more corymbose inflorescence with c. 20 flowers. Further a sterile specimen from Mountain Province, Conklin &amp; Buwaya 1-937 (PNH 79526) probably belongs here.</string>

				<string>Bauhinia rahmatii is a very distinct species. De Wit regards it as synonymous with Phanera dasycarpa Miq. but this is a name given to a single specimen collected by Teijsmann from Sumatra. The holotype in U consists of one sterile branch and a loose, woody-valved pod, c. 25 by 6 cm, without seeds; the valves are brownish velutinous. The texture and indumentum of the leaves, however, do not suggest this to be identical with B. rahmatii, so we are not able to place this collection with certainty.</string>

					<subHeading>General Note</subHeading>This is the most widely distributed species of the Malesian Bauhinias and a great many collections have been available to us. It is a highly polymorphous species, composed of numerous isolated populations. There is, however, a continuous variation from small to large leaves with a varying indumentum and varying bud shapes with long to short hypanthium. We have separated some of the more remarkable local 'types' as varieties. Local floras may well in the future distinguish more, and some may even be tempted to treat these as species, as has been the case with, e.g., B. perkinsae and B. stenostachya.<br/>
The best character for recognizing Bauhinia semibifida is the distinctly dilated hypanthium.<br/>
Bauhinia excurrens Stapf, regarded as a variety by De Wit, is treated as a separate species and B. subglabra Merr. is regarded as belonging to B. aherniana Perkins, which undoubtedly is a closely related species.<br/>
Besides the varieties described below some of the variations are worthwhile mentioning. The stigma is usually large and peltate; from Sabah we have measured 8 mm in diameter in a herbarium specimen. Also the anthers are large and 15 mm is the largest measure, again from Sabah. The hypanthium varies quite a lot, it measures usually c. 10 mm, in large-flowered specimens from N Borneo we have measured 15 mm, lengthening to 20 mm after anthesis. We have found a collection from Sumatra with a long hypanthium and a small, almost capitate stigma; while in the Philippines the hypanthium tends to be short, 5-6 mm and only slightly dilated; this is combined with generally smaller flowers. The great majority of all the collections, however, falls within var. semibifida, first of all characterized by the tubular hypanthium dilated at the base. The flowers are white, turning yellowish or yellowish green, and the stigma is large and peltate, oblique.</string>

				<string>The species in section Palmatifolia are often less well defined than in the other sections. Floral characters are rather uniform but there are great variations in the inflorescence structure and in the size, texture, nervation and form of the leaves. We have maintained a rather conventional taxonomy of the group and avoided drastic lumping as well as splitting. It is possible that, after a closer study in nature, a different viewpoint could be defended. We have had to leave this to the future.</string>
				<num>2</num>
				<string>In more than one species of this section it has been noted that the pollen is released through the pore together with a drop of colourless fluid. This fluid is very viscous and dries very slowly; in some cases it has been observed that ants are attracted to this, and thus may play a role as pollinators.</string>

				<string>Prain (I.c.) recognized two closely related species, Bauhinia bidentata and B. cornifolia; in the former the ovary is described as sparsely pubescent, in the latter as densely rusty downy; however, some of the specimens he quoted under cornifolia have an ovary apparently similar to the type of bidentata; some of the specimens he quoted under bidentata have a sparsely pubescent ovary except Wallich 5778 from Penang, which has the ovary densely hairy as the type of B. bidentata. We have, therefore, reestablished var. breviflora to accommodate part of his B. bidentata.</string>

De Wit indicated Ridley 9670 as 'lectotype' but as it is not mentioned in the protologue it is correctly a neotype. We have not seen this specimen either. Two specimens collected by Ridley are in the type cover in K: one from the type locality, nr. 9669, collected in 1896, the other s.n., collected in 1914. Whether these belong to B. cuprea has still to be studied, but they are close to B. bidentata.</string>

					<subHeading>Note</subHeading>In the present treatment we have followed the generic concept of Irwin &amp; Barneby (l.c. 1981: 97-106), who through three decades have studied the tribe Cassieae of the New World and proposed a reorganization of the tribe. This has now been generally accepted even if it breaks with the most common arrangements in Floras and Herbaria. In the 'neighbouring' Floras, i.e. Flora of Thailand and Flore du Cambodge, du Laos et du Viet-Nam, the genus Cassia has been treated in its wider sense. We have here, inconveniently, decided to follow the newer system, partly because it is widely accepted, e.g. by the ILDIS-database, partly because Irwin and Barneby have reevaluated and typified a number of widespread taxa in our region, and finally because the great majority of the species occurring in the Malesian region are introduced, cultivated or, in several cases, naturalized. In the genus Cassia only one species is indigenous, in Senna probably only 3 out of 17 treated here, and in Chamaecrista one or two only.<br/>
A number of taxa, occasionally recorded as in cultivation in Malesia, have not been included. See also page 565.</string>

De Wit (I.e.) discusses in detail whether it is native in the Malesian area and compares the distribution with that of the other monsoon species as, e.g., Bauhinia viridescens, B. malabarica, B. pottsii, Cassia javanica and Tectona grandis, all bicentric in their distribution, avoiding the humid tropics; this points towards a relict distribution pattern. It is thus possible that C. fistula is indigenous to the monsoon part of Indonesia.

					<subHeading>Note</subHeading>Cassia javanica is a very polymorphous species with a wide distribution range from N India through the Indochinese Peninsula and the Malesian region to New Guinea. We agree with Irwin &amp; Barneby (l.c.) that Cassia pubiflora and C. microcalyx belong here. Cassia agnes, C. nodosa, C. renigera, and C. bartonii are also better treated as subspecies; the last two taxa show a certain degree of similarity even if they represent the most westernly and easternly variation of Cassia javanica.<br/>
We have treated the variation throughout on subspecific instead of varietal level in order to bring the present treatment as close as possible in conformity with the previous treatments in the Flora of Cambodia, Laos &amp; Vietnam and that of Thailand.</string>

				<string>We regard this species as indigenous in SE Asia and are not able to follow Irwin &amp; Barneby in joining it with Chamaecrista nicticans as a var. glabrata. There is, however, still work to be done with the C. mimosoides-leschenaultiana complex in tropical Asia; e.g. Verdcourt (l.c.) is of the opinion that in New Guinea a mixture of indigenous and introduced elements occur and one collection from 1600 m ('area 6, Wamena') is an exceptionally robust plant with hairy fruits up to 6.5 by 0.6 cm. Also elsewhere special ecotypes occur; K. &amp; S.S.Larsen (1980: 108) mentioned some very small forms from the Indo-Chinese area. Cassia leschenaultiana var. auricoma Grah. ex de Wit represents a part of a clinal variation that we do not find necessary to recognize taxonomically.</string>

				<string>Hasskarl (l.c.) based his new species Touchiroa? bantamensis on living plants cultivated in the Botanical Garden Bogor, without designating the type. Dr Elizabeth Widjaja (in litt.) informed me that there is no herbarium specimen of that species made by Hasskarl in BO. For the type of this species, De Wit (l.c.) appointed the specimen collected in March 1925 by an unknown collector, from a tree originating from a Hasskarl collection from Bantam (W Java) in 1841, and cultivated in the Botanical Garden Bogor, under the number of I-i-38, as cited above.</string>
				<num>2</num>
				<string>This species is said to be found often in W Java. Fischer (l.c.) reported one collection of it from Sabah (Arsat 1244, SAN). I have not seen this specimen. Recently the species was found in E Kalimantan (Wanariset): Ambri &amp;. Arifin W845, L). Cultivated in Java (Hort. Bog., sub no. I-B-5a, I-I-38 &amp; 38a).</string>

					<subHeading>Note</subHeading>The type of Crudia lanceolata Ridley was collected by Mohamed Haniff (or Aniff) from Langkawi and was cited in the protologue without the collector's number. I examined the type in K, which is numbered 75539' in Ridley's handwriting, and was previously named and reported by him (1911) as Crudia curtisii Prain. This rather high collection number is treated here as belonging to (Herb.) Ridley or his series.</string>

				<string>This species is distinct from all other species of Dialium. Mature flower buds as well as anthers are the largest in the genus. The base of the flower bud is usually incurved appearing distinctly zygomorphic, and the receptacle is deeply concave with filaments and ovary inserted excentrically on opposite sides.</string>
				<num>2</num>
				<string>By the size of the leaflets and colour and quality of the indumentum on their under- surface the species can be segregated into more or less discrete 'groups'. The 'maingayi' group has a rather whitish to slightly golden indumentum underneath, the nerves are not very distinct. The 'platysepalum' group is the most common group, but not easily separated from the previous one; the leaves are often tinged golden underneath. Leaves in the 'wallichii' group are slightly golden or light yellow beneath but the blades are smaller, not more than 7 by 2 cm. In the 'kingii' group leaves are slightly larger than in 'wallichii', the undersurface is golden to chocolate brown, the nerves are prominent. In the 'triste' group the chocolate brown leaves are still larger and the nerves much more prominent. The differences between the 'groups' are slight and they form a gradient with intermediate specimens, so they are given no taxonomic and nomenclatural status.</string>

					<subHeading>Note</subHeading>Van Steenis &amp; De Wit (I.e.) cited the type for their new species Endertia spectabilis as "Nieuwenhuis 947 (18.V.1897), cultivated in Hort. Bot. sub I.B.90, collected in 1930." There is one herbarium specimen of Nieuwenhuis 947 in BO, as Dr Elizabeth Widjaja (in litt.) informed me. This specimen and the one collected in 1930 from the tree that originated from Nieuwenhuis' collection from Kalimantan, cultivated under no. I-B-90 in the Botanic Garden Bogor, can be considered as authentic material of Endertia spectabilis, so both are treated here as syntypes. Several good fertile specimens were in the course of time collected from the same tree in the Garden and some herbarium specimens were also collected from the wild in Borneo.</string>

Bogor' (now BO) without citation of specimens and without designation of the type. The species was later treated as a synonym of G. rolfei in the publications of Koorders-Schumacher (l.c.) and Koorders (l.c. 1918). The Koorders collections were then cited under that species. These collections obviously belong to the authentic material of G. celebica, so they may be (all) considered as the syntypes. So far I have not found any published lectotypification of the name.</string>

				<string>The medium- to large-sized trees of Kingiodendron can be easily identified to the genus by a combination of the following characters: 1) slashed wood usually exuding a green sap, 2) leaflets with pellucid dots, 3) indehiscent pods, and 4) strongly folded cotyledons which can be easily observed in a section. However, fertile collections, especially fruiting material, are needed for further study of the species in this group (cf. Verdcourt, l.c.).</string>

				<string>The flowers of this genus have been described as bisexual. However, some of them appear to be heterostylous, with fertile or (partly) sterile stamens. Verdcourt (l.c.) stated that possible presence of functionally male or female flowers needs investigation.</string>

Because the two genera had never been revised as a whole and there had been confusion concerning their generic limits, Knaap-van Meeuwen (1970) made a thorough study of the genera, reviewing the history of their classification. She redelimited the two genera and listed the main differences especially in floral characters in the keys to the genera in her revision. Since then her delimitation of the two genera has generally been followed by, for example, Verdcourt (1979), Cowan &amp; Polhill (1981), A.C. Smith <annotation>[<references>

				<string>Saraca cauliflora has been placed in the synonymy of S. declinata by Zuijderhoudt (1968: 419). After having examined the authentic specimens and the original description as mentioned above, I found it is conspecific with S. thaipingensis. As described by Baker it has long petiolules (c. 12.5 mm long), ample, dense corymbs, and about 7 stamens, which are all traits characteristic for S. thaipingensis.</string>
				<num>2</num>
				<string>The distinct, long petiolules (often 10-15 mm long), large and caducous bracts (which can be observed on very young inflorescences; 12-35 by 7-22 mm), rather big, robust inflorescences (up to 35, rarely to 40 cm wide), and large pods (up to 45, rarely to 50 cm long, 10 cm wide) are very characteristic for this species.</string>

				<string>In our area probably only 3 species are indigenous: Senna divaricata, S. timoriensis and S. tora. It is doubtful whether S. siamea is indigenous and the remaining 14 species have all been introduced. Some of them are probably only occasionally met with outside gardens. There are others which we have decided not to include in the key as they have never had any larger distribution as garden plants and are hardly found in any natural vegetation type. A number of taxa, occasionally recorded as in cultivation in Malesia have not been included. See the list on page 690.</string>

Irwin and Barneby (1982) have combined several species under Senna hirsuta which is an extremely variable species in which they recognize 7 varieties, mainly separated on variations in the indumentum and on the shape of the pod; whether it is possible to maintain them shall not be judged here; some of the varieties are based on very few collections. Var. puberula, however, of which C. leptocarpa is a synonym, seems rather distinct from the typical var. hirsuta.</string>

				<string>This species is so closely related to Senna tora that several authors have regarded them as conspecific, e.g. Bentham. However, it concerns two clearly separated taxa best kept at species level; this was elegantly demonstrated by Brenan. The strong foetid smell of S. tora is usually absent from S. obtusifolia which is also recognizable by the much longer pedicels and by the differences in the areole. The singular foliar gland is mostly a good character; it is, however, pointed out by several authors that particularly in Africa a 'race' with two foliar glands has been introduced and spread. Generally S. obtusifolia is readily recognizable even in the field by the longer pedicels.</string>

					<subHeading>Note</subHeading>The present genus was reduced to Dialium as a subgenus by Steyaert (l.c.). Rojo (l.c.), after a comprehensive study of the genus Dialium, excluded the genus Uittienia from Dialium and reinstated it as a monotypic genus within the same subtribe (i.e. tribe Cassieae subtribe Dialiinae Irwin &amp; Barneby).<br/>
According to Rojo (l.c.: 100) the fruit of Dialium "has a thin crustaceous exocarp which is usually hairy and easily crushed or sometimes detached from the adjacent meso- carp," while the fruit of Uittienia "does not have a crustaceous exocarp but instead has a thick (c. 4-5 mm) and hard pericarp which when dry is uncrushable by hardest press between two hands." See Rojo's figures 2.18b and 3.1 f/g.</string>

					<subHeading>Note</subHeading>Verdcourt (I.e.) identified a specimen collected from the tree cultivated in the Botanic Garden at Lae as 'Brownea ariza Benth., Hybrid?' and stated that it differs from the type of that species in having the filaments united at the base for a longer distance (against entirely free in that species); he also remarked that "it is possibly a hybrid with one of the species with much longer staminal tubes."<br/>
From the specimens collected at Lae, e.g. LAE 72341, in both fl. &amp; fr. (L), the stamens are 3-3.5 cm with their basal 7-17 mm united. They match rather well those collected from trees in the Botanic Garden Bogor, under the name Brownea capitella Jacq.</string>

				<string>Dahlgren et al. (1985) placed both genera, plus Luzuriaga, Behnia and Elachanthera, in the Luzuriagaceae, separate from the Philesiaceae, whereas Dahlgren &amp; Clifford (1982) included them in the Philesiaceae. Cronquist (1981) put them in the Smilacaceae. More recent cladistic and phenetic evidence suggests that, while Eustrephus and Geitonople- sium are closely related to each other, they are only distantly related to Luzuriaga and Philesia (Conran 1987a). Their closest relatives appear to be in the Phormiaceae (Con- ran 1989). The two genera are here treated in the separate family Geitonoplesiaceae. Both species are highly variable. Several synonyms and infraspecific taxa have been proposed, although none is here accepted (Schlittler 1951; Conran 1987b; Laferriere 1995).

				<string>Eustrephus and Geitonoplesium have different pollen types (Schulze 1982). Pollen of Eustrephus is monocolpate, elliptic in polar view, and measures 40-(47)-52 x 29- (32)-35 &#181;m. Radulescu (1973) gives larger sizes: 53-62 x 31-41 &#181;m. The colpus ends extend slightly on the proximal side of the pollen grain. Exine thickness is 1-1.5 &#181;m. The sexine, which consists of a tectum and a columellate infratectal layer, is slightly thicker than the nexine. The ornamentation is microreticulate all-over. The diameter of the lumina (&lt; 1 &#181;m) decreases towards the aperture.
Pollen of Geitonoplesium is trichotomocolpate, obtusely triangular with convex sides in polar view, oblate (P/E = c. 0.67), and measures 23-(26)-33 &#181;m in equatorial diameter. The ends of the three-armed colpus reach the proximal side. Exine thickness is c. 1 &#181;m. The ornamentation is microreticulate (diameter lumina &lt; 1 &#181;m). Along with several trichotomocolpate collections Erdtman (1952) describes a deviating pollen sample from New Caledonia (Franc 627; "determination confirmed by Skottsberg") as monocolpate, 49 x 36 &#181;m, which reminds much of Eustrephus pollen.
Monocolpate pollen is common in the Asparagales (sensu Dahlgren &amp; Clifford 1982). Trichotomocolpate pollen occurs (see also Schulze 1982) in the Asphodelaceae (subfam. Anthericoideae: 9 genera), Dianellaceae (Dianella: also tetrachotomocolpate; Stypandra), Doryanthaceae (Doryanthes: rarely; Herpolirion) and Phormiaceae (.Phormium).

				<string>The genera here recognized in Hernandiaceae have a checkered taxonomic history. Kubitzki (1969) comprehensively dealt with it. Most authors agree upon a relation with Lauraceae. Gyrocarpus is often placed in a separate family, Gyrocarpaceae. Pax (1889) established Hernandiaceae in the present sense, with four genera, divided into two subfamilies, Hernandioideae (Hernandia and Illigera) and Gyrocarpoideae (Gyrocarpus and Sparattanthelium)', this was followed by Kubitzki (1969). See also page 761.

				<string>
					<subHeading>Leaf Anatomy</subHeading>Metcalfe (1987) gave a detailed leaf anatomical account of all genera, incorporating information from the literature. Below follows a summary for the three genera occurring in Malesia. Nonglandular, simple hairs range from straight to curved or hooked. Glandular hairs are absent from Gyrocarpus; in Hernandia and Illigera they are globular or pear-shaped with a unicellular stalk and a unicellular or multicellular body. Stomata paracytic in Illigera and Hernandia; the anomocytic stomata in Gyrocarpus have parallel cuticular flanges, recalling paracytic stomata. Cystoliths present in Gyrocarpus, absent in Hernandia and Illigera.<br/>
					<subHeading>Wood Anatomy</subHeading>For full bibliographies on the wood anatomy of Hernandiaceae, see Gregory (1994) and Metcalfe (1987). Growth rings absent to distinct. Vessels diffuse, solitary and in radial multiples, with simple perforations. Intervessel pits alternate, vessel-ray pits coarse and with reduced borders. Fibres thin-walled in most species, with minutely bordered to simple pits (Gyrocarpus, Hernandia) or distinctly bordered ones (Illigera). Parenchyma paratracheal, vasicentric to aliform (Gyrocarpus and Hernandia) or scanty (Illigera). Rays mostly multiseriate, homocellular to heterocellular. Secretory (oil or mucilage) cells present in varying frequency among the axial parenchyma in Gyrocarpus and Hernandia, among ray parenchyma in Illigera. Crystalliferous cells noted in rays of some species of Hernandia.<br/>
					<subHeading>Taxonomic aspects</subHeading>On balance the anatomical evidence is inconclusive with respect to the status of Gyrocarpus and the New World genus Sparattanthelium as a separate family, Gyrocarpaceae. In their leaf anatomy the latter share the presence of cystoliths (also present in the wood of Sparattanthelium) but in wood anatomy they do not differ substantially from Hernandia; Illigera appears more isolated.

				<string>Pollen of the Hernandiaceae has been more or less extensively described and illustrated with light micrographs or drawings by Agababian (1969), Kubitzki (1969) and Mitroiu (1970). Scanning electron micrographs of Illigera pollen were included by Walker (1976a, b), Straka &amp; Friedrich (1988) and Tang &amp; Shang (1995).<br/>
The pollen grains of the Hernandiaceae are small to very large (19-168 &#181;m), spheroidal and inaperturate (functionally omniaperturate). The exine is very thin, intectate, and loosely to densely covered with warts {Sparattanthelium) or 1.8 to 9.6 &#181;m long spines. A transmission electron micrograph of the wall of Hernandia pollen (Hesse &amp; Kubitzki 1983) shows a c. 0.4 &#181;m thick granular exine with a solid conical spine. In Illigera pollen the spines have flattened contiguous bases. The intine is always distinctly thicker than the exine. In Hernandia and Illigera it consists of a thin homogeneous inner layer and a thick outer channeled layer. In the other two genera the intine seems to be homogeneous throughout (Kubitzki 1969).<br/>
Two pollen types may be distinguished: Hernandia and Illigera have large (83-168 &#181;m) pollen grains, provided with pollenkitt and a stratified intine, while Gyrocarpus and Sparattanthelium have smaller (19-64 &#181;m) grains, without pollenkitt, and, as far as known, a homogeneous intine. These differences are probably associated with contrasting pollination types: entomogamy and anemogamy respectively.<br/>
The pollen grains of Hernandia and Illigera are very similar. However, no special characters indicating the monophyly of the family in its present circumscription have been found. Pollen of the Hernandiaceae is like that of several Lauraceae, and the pollen of Hernandia and Illigera also resembles that of Peumus of the Monimiaceae (Erdtman 1952; Shutts 1960; Walker 1976a, b; Hesse &amp; Kubitzki 1983; Tang &amp; Shang 1995). A cladistic analysis of 49 taxa of Magnoliidae by Loconte &amp; Stevenson (1991) using 104 characters confirmed the monophyly of the Hernandiaceae and the above subdivision of the family, and indicated a sister group relation to the Lauraceae. However, pollen morphology did not contribute to these results, because the ten pollen characters used were coded similarly in the Lauraceae and the four genera of the Hernandiaceae.

Kubitzki (1969) investigated phenolics in hydrolized leaf extracts and reported genus- characteristic patterns. Kaempferol, quercetin and its 3'-methylether isorhamnetin were detected in 14 taxa of Hernandia and occurred erratically and usually in trace amounts only in Illigera (16 taxa investigated), Gyrocarpus americanus and jatrophifolius and Sparattanthelium (12 taxa). Vitexin-like C-glycoflavones were present in Hernandia albiflora and in all taxa of Illigera and in trace amounts in 7 taxa of Sparattanthelium. Proanthocyanidins were present in large to moderate amounts in 7 taxa of Hernandia, 14 taxa of Illigera, but were totally lacking in Gyrocarpus and Sparattanthelium. Ferulic and sinapic acids were detected in trace to moderate amounts in practically all taxa of Hernandia, Gyrocarpus and Sparattanthelium and were lacking in Illigera. The apparent absence of the wide-spread p-coumaric and caffeic acids and the greatly reduced or totally suppressed production of flavonols and flavones in Gyrocarpus and Sparattanthelium represent notable features of phenolic metabolism of Hernandiaceae. Concerning flavonoids it should not be forgotten, however, that screening procedures of the type applied by Kubitzki and making use of herbarium material are useless for the detection of flavanones and flavanonols (= 2,3-dihydroflavonols). Indeed, prenylated and/or geranylated flavanones, the nymphaeols -A to -C, were isolated from H. nymphaeifolia (Presl) Kubitzki (= H. peltata; Japanese name 'Hasunoha-giri') (Yakushijin et al. 1980).<br/>
One class of compounds is relatively well known from the family. Alkaloids have been detected in all four to five genera. They belong to the phenylalanine-tyrosine- derived family of isoquinoline alkaloids and are represented by the benzylisoquinoline-, aporphine-, oxo-aporphine-, N,N-dimethylaminoethyl-phenanthrene-types and by di- meric derivatives of these monomers. A strange compound is 3-cyano-4-methoxy- pyridine from H. nymphaeifolia (Yakushijin et al. 1980); as yet its biogenesis is not known.<br/>
Lignans seem to occur frequently in stems, leaves and seeds of many species of Hernandia. Hitherto they were not yet isolated from representatives of other hernandiaceous genera. Known Hernandia lignans belong to several types: furofuranoid-, tetralin (= tetra- hydronaphthalene)-, naphthalene- and bibenzylbutanolide-types; examples (isolated from Hernandia taxa) are epimagnolin, podophyllotoxin, 1,2,3,4-tetradehydrodehydroxy- podophyllotoxin and podorhizol. Two new lignans, dimethylmatairesinol and 5'-meth- oxypodorhizol, were isolated from seeds of H. ovigera\ seeds of this taxon yielded eleven lignans till today (Tanoguchi et al. 1991). Neolignans were not yet detected in the family.<br/>
Oil cells of the magnolioid type are wide-spread in the family; they occur mainly in leaves and in the primary cortex and pith of stems (Kubitzki 1969) and perhaps also in roots and fruits. Their presence indicates that essential oils should be of common occurrence. However, only a few investigations of essential oils are reported in literature. Hernandia peltata yielded essential oils from roots, stems and fruits in Madagascar; the wood oil (2%) had perillaldehyde as main compound and myrtenal, cineol and limonene as additional monoterpenes. The smell of perillaldehyde is described in literature as cuminlike or as camphoraceous (Gildemeister &amp; Hoffmann 1959,1963; Guenther 1949; Weber 1974). Perillaldehyde is also the principal constituent of the essential oil of bark and twigs of Madagascan H. voyroni <annotation>[= Hazomalania voyroni (Jumelle) Capuron]</annotation>(Weber 1974).<br/>
Metcalfe (1987) stated "oil cells have been reported in all genera and species and they are sometimes accompanied by mucilage cells." The last-mentioned feature reminds of Lauraceae and explains observations made by Greshoff that the bark of H. ovigera and H. sonora is mucilagineous.<br/>
Hernandiaceae have seeds without endosperm (all ?) containing embryos with large cotyledons. Some hints can be found in literature that several species store large amounts of fatty oils in their seeds, but exact information is scarce. According to Netolitzki (1926) Hernandiaceae (which?) store fatty oils, protein bodies and starch in cotyledons. Corner (1976) stressed the fact that hitherto only seeds of Hernandia were studied in some detail and drew attention to similarities between seeds of Hernandia and those of Myristi- caceae.<br/>
Usually affinities of Hernandiaceae with Lauraceae and Monimiaceae are assumed. As far as chemical data are available they do not contradict such a relationship.

					<subHeading>Note</subHeading>Hernandia moerenhoutiana is common and widespread in the Pacific. Kubitzki (1969) accepted in this species three subspecies, viz. subsp. moerenhoutiana (Tahiti, Cook Is.), subsp. campanulata (Tonga Is., Fiji, Samoa) and subsp. samoensis (Solomon Is., Santa Cruz, Samoa). A much related species, H. cordigera Vieillard, is restricted to New Caledonia. Kubitzki distinguished these two species on the dimensions of the cupule at anthesis: broader than long leads to H. cordigera and longer than broad to H. moerenhoutiana. Croft (1981) put the Malesian material into subsp. samoensis, but I doubt whether this is correct: the cupules are broader than long and the leaf apices also do not match. The Malesian material very much resembles H. cordigera, and pending the availability of more material I prefer to leave it in H. moerenhoutiana s.l.; possibly the Malesian and part of the Solomon material represents a fourth subspecies, as yet undescribed.</string>

				<string>Illigera appendiculata as a whole seems of rare occurrence; there are but a few recent collections. This was already observed by Backer (1913) for Java and by Schmutz for Sumbawa; the latter noted on the field label that he found the species only twice.</string>
				<num>2</num>
				<string>The only collections seen from East Kalimantan (Endert 5140, Kostermans 6822), as well as the one from Celebes (.Bunnemeijer 10580), concern flowering specimens, and it cannot yet be decided to which subspecies they belong.</string>
				<num>3</num>
				<string>The majority of the herbarium collections concerns flowering material. Fruits of subsp. appendiculata are known only of two collections (Sumatra and W Java); subsp. stenoptera is known from three fruiting collections (Kangean I., Sumbawa and Flores) only, and more fruit-bearing material is needed to ascertain the status of the latter sub- species.</string>

				<string>Apparently a rare species and seldom collected in flower. Merrill (1914) described fruits only. I have seen only two collections with flowers: Ridsdale 1171 (immature flowers, Mindoro) and Nordin Abas SAN 85879 (Sabah).</string>
				<num>2</num>
				<string>Kubitzki (1969) regarded the presence or absence of domatia taxonomically an important character; I found that they are mostly absent in I. megaptera from the Philippines, but in the Sabah material they are present.</string>
				<num>3</num>
				<string>Illigera megaptera resembles I. luzonensis, the latter differs e.g. by shorter leaflets and shorter fruit wings (hemi-orbicular or sublingulate).</string>
				<num>4</num>
				<string>Doubtful specimens are Clemens 26185 and 51587, both from Mt Kinabalu, with flowers only. Their resemblance in habit with I. megaptera is evident, so I named them provisionally under that species, although fruits are unknown. Their provenance, from an exceptionally high altitude, c. 1700 m, urged Kubitzki (1969) to place these two Clemens specimens under I. khasiana Clarke, a species from mountainous continental SE Asia. To me this seems unlikely, and more complete material from Mt Kinabalu is needed for a final decision.</string>

				<heading>EMBRYOLOGY AND TAXONOMIC POSITION OF HERNANDIACEAE</heading>
				<string>A recent study (Heo &amp; Tobe 1995) on the embryology of Gyrocarpus (G. jatrophi-folius) and Hernandia (H. cordigera, H. nymphaeifolia) disclosed that no synapomor-phies exist for these two genera. They are rather divergent in various characters, which supports the prevalent acceptance of two subfamilies in the Hernandiaceae: a derived subfamily Hernandioideae and a less specialized subfamily Gyrocarpoideae (see under Taxonomy, page 738). Nevertheless, Hernandiaceae evidently is one separate family belonging in the Laurales, because both Gyrocarpus and Hernandia share various syn-apomorphies with other lauralian families, as was also previously supported by cladistic and DNA analyses. However, embryologically no evidence was found to separate Hernandiaceae from Lauraceae, whereas the genus Hernandia shares two synapomorphies with the latter family, viz. pachychalazy (ramified raphal vascular bundles at the chalaza) and ruminate cotyledons.

				<string>The systematic position of the Lowiaceae is undisputed; since its establishment it has been recognized as belonging to the order Zingiberales.<br/>
The only genus Orchidantha was described by N.E. Brown, who published O. borneensis on 23 October 1886 in a note titled "A new genus oiScitamineaeT He stated: "for the present I place it in the Museae" The plant was introduced from Borneo without indication of locality and grown at Ghent, Belgium.<br/>
On the 25th of October of the same year Scortechini published Lowia as a new genus from the Malay Peninsula based on L. longiflora from Perak. Also he referred it to the tribe Museae, regarding it as closely related to Heliconia. On account of the developed labellum he suggested it being a link between Museae and Zingibereae.<br/>
In 1893 Ridley published Protamomum maxillarioides, also from the Malay Peninsula. He knew of Scortechini's description, but not of Brown's, and recognized his genus as belonging to the same group as Lowia; he proposed the family name Lowia-ceae, without any formal description.<br/>
In 1897 K. Schumann treated the group under Musaceae as Lowieae in Engler &amp; Prantl, Nat. Pflanzenfamilien, and as Lowioideae in Das Pflanzenreich three years later. H. Winkler followed him in the second edition of Engler &amp; Prantl's Pflanzenfamilien (1930). Ridley established the family in 1924, in 1941 T. Nakai <annotation>[<references>

Cladistic analyses undertaken by Dahlgren et al. (1985), Kress (1990) and Smith et al. (1993), all using different outgroups, show its relationship to the group of families related to Musaceae, rather than to the Zingiberaceae-Marantaceae group, and are thus in full agreement with the observations and conclusions of Brown. The study by Smith et al. (1993) involved the analysis of chloroplast DNA of Orchidantha fimbriata and O. siamensis.<br/>
The most striking character of the family is the enlargement of the median petal to a labellum as in the orchids, hence the name Orchidantha. However, little is known about the family. To quote Kress (1990): "The Lowiaceae are among the most poorly known taxa in the order in terms of taxonomy, general morphology, embryology, chemistry, and ecology."

He also observed from old inflorescences a succession of scars where the flowers had fallen, with two bract scars between each; he concluded that the cyme is close to being a cincinnus The bracts are all more or less tubular at base and their orientation is not easy to establish The ovary has an apical prolongation which is sometimes called a calyx tube or hyp-anthium. It is, however, solid with a central vascular strand connecting the base of the style with the ovary; here the term ovary extension, introduced by Holttum, has beer. used. The sepals (or outer tepals) are similar; the petals (or inner tepals) are arranged as in an orchid flower with two lateral petals and a labellum. The flower is resupinate. The lateral petals are small and overlap the stamens; the labellum is variously shaped. in some species having a narrower proximal part and a broad distal part, in other species (e. g. O. holttumii) the whole labellum is rather broad but distally curved back and forming a claw-like structure. The labellum often has lamellae along the vascular strands. These parts may play a role in pollination.

				<string>The roots are relatively thick and air channels are present. Vessels are present in the roots only and have scalariform perforation plates with numerous bars. The rhizomes are rich in small, angular starch grains quite different from those found in Musaceae and Strelitziaceae. The chlorenchyma of the lamina is without a palisade layer and consists of an irregular mixture of small and large cells. The leaf axis includes two distinct systems of narrow air canals. Stomata are paracytic with deeply sunken subsidiary cells. Stegmata are present in the form of 'hat-shaped' silica-bodies. Raphide sacs are common, especially in the rhizome. Crystals of calcium oxalate are found in all parts. Tannins occur only in the rhizome.<br/>
All in all Lowiaceae are anatomically very different from the other families in Zingi-berales.

				<string>Very little is known about the pollination. The flowers of Orchidantha fimbriatum have a foul smell (Corner writes on a label that they smell of "bugs and coconut-oil"). The labellum is white and placed close to the soil, and the succulent central part along the midvein contains cells with nutritious tissue, protein cells. Kress (pers. comm.) reports that the labellum is eaten during the night; he suggests that small primatess, tree shrews (Tupaiidae), feed on the labellum then. Orchidantha holttumii, on the other hand, has purple flowers smelling of horse-dung (Boyce) or fish (Dransfield), and the labellum is erect during anthesis. This species may be pollinated by flies.

				<writer>(R. Hegnauer)</writer>
				<string>Formerly Lowioideae (Orchidantha), Strelitzioideae (including Heliconiaceae 3 or 4 genera) and Musoideae (1-3 genera) formed one family, Musaceae s.l. As the chemistry of all these taxa is rather poorly known at present, some general remarks about chemical characters of Musaceae s.l. seem to be appropriate here. For recent reviews see Tomlinson (1959, 1969), Hegnauer (1963, 1986) and Dahlgren et al. (1985). It should be stressed that some of the important anatomical and chemical characters of Musaceae s.l. are intimately connected: structures of starch grains, crystals of calcium oxalate (raphides and other crystal-types), silica bodies located in longitudinal rows of specific silica-cells, called stegmata, and 'tannins' in ordinary parenchymatic cells or deposited in idioblasts or articulated lactifers with their mucilagineous tannin-like and polyisoprenoid contents; rubber-like polyisoprenes seem to be restricted to Musaceae s.str. The tannins of Musaceae s.l. are of the condensed type; all seem to be proantho-cyanidin oligo- and polymers yielding pelargonidin, cyanidin and/or delphinidin on treatment with mineralic acids. Serious chemical investigations are restricted to Musa-ceae s.str. apart from a flavonoid survey of Zingiberales by Williams &amp; Harborne (1977); leaves of most representatives of Musaceae s.l. contained glycosides of the flavonols kaempferol and quercetin, but lacked glycosides of myricetin, flavones and C-glycoflavones; flavonoid content of leaves of Orchidantha maxillarioides, the onh investigated taxon belonging to Lowiaceae, was so low that no positive identification-were possible. According to Tomlinson proanthocyanidins are restricted in Lowiaceae to subterranean parts. Remarkable observations were published recently for bananas (Musa acuminata, M. x paradisiaca). Fruits of vegetable varieties of banana are used in. India as anti-ulcerogenic medicine; the active principles were reported to be acylated (16:0; 18:1) 3-glycosidic derivatives of sitosterol, called sitoindosides I to IV (Ghosu. &amp; Saini 1984; Ghosal 1985). Musa acuminata 'Giant Cavendish', has Colletotrichium. rawsae-resistant fruits; unripe fruits were shown to produce the phenalenone-type phyto-alexin 2-(4'-hydroxyphenyl-)naphthalic anhydride after infection with conidia of this pathogen (Hirai et al. 1994). A year before Luis et al. (1993) had isolated two phenale-nones, irenolone and emenolone, from banana leaves infected with Mycosphaerella fidjiensis. It is noteworthy that these phytoalexins strongly remind the yellow to red pigments of Haemodoraceae (see Flora Malesiana I, 11: 357 and Hegnauer 1986: 659 Tomlinson stressed the fact that from an anatomical point of view Lowioideae have an isolated position within Musaceae s.l.; one argument is based on the structure of their rather small and often composite starch grains which strongly deviate from the zingiber-alean type present in the rest ofMusaceae s.l. Other pleas for family status of Lowiaceae are based on epicuticular leaf waxes which are lacking in Orchidantha, but are represented in all other investigated Musaceae s.l. by the so-called Strelitzia-type (Fröhlich &amp; Barth-lott 1988), and by a low diameter of their sieve-element plastides which belong to the P2cs-type (i.e. containing cuneate protein crystals and starch grains) in all Zingiberales (Behnke 1994). Chemically the Strelitzia-type wax rodlets of Musaceae are composed predominantly of wax esters which are accompanied by alkanes, alkanols, alkanals and free fatty acids; triterpenoids are lacking (Heliconia, Strelitzia) (Meusel et al. 1994).

				<string>Little is known about the pollen morphology of the Lowiaceae. Winkler (1930) and Erdtman (1952) described the pollen grains of Orchidantha as spheroidal and psilate. According to Lane (1955) the pollen is 'granular' and very large. Kress (1986,1990) implicitly described Lowiaceae pollen as inaperturate (functionally omniaperturate), with a reduced, non-stratified, poorly sculptured exine and an elaborated, stratified intine. Such pollen is ubiquitous in the Zingiberales, and is probably a primitive character of the order.<br/>
Light microscopic observation of the pollen of Orchidantha longiflora (untreated material from specimen HBL 06527 in the Hortus Botanicus, Leiden) shows subspheroi- dal (long axis av. 165 &#181;m, short axis av. 150 &#181;m), inaperturate, psilate grains. The pollen wall is 4-6 &#181;m thick and possibly completely intinous. It consists of a thick (1/2- 4/5), densely radially striate outer layer ('exintine') and a usually thinner, homogeneous inner layer ('endintine').
